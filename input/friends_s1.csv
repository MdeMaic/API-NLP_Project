0,0,Monica,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,0,There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
1,1,Joey,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,1,"C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!"
2,2,Chandler,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,2,"All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
3,3,Phoebe,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,3,"Wait, does he eat chalk?"
4,4,Phoebe,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,4,"Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!"
5,5,Monica,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,5,"Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
6,6,Chandler,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,6,Sounds like a date to me.
7,7,Chandler,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,7,"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
9,9,Chandler,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,9,"Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there."
10,10,Joey,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,10,Instead of...?
11,11,Chandler,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,11,That's right.
12,12,Joey,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,12,Never had that dream.
13,13,Phoebe,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,13,No.
14,14,Chandler,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,14,"All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me."
15,15,Monica,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,15,And they weren't looking at you before?!
16,16,Chandler,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,16,"Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
17,17,Ross,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,17,(mortified) Hi.
18,18,Joey,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,18,"This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
19,19,Monica,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,19,"Are you okay, sweetie?"
20,20,Ross,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,20,"I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck..."
21,21,Chandler,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,21,Cookie?
22,22,Monica,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,22,(explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.
23,23,Joey,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,23,Ohh.
24,24,Monica,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,24,(to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
25,25,Ross,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,25,Thanks.
26,26,Phoebe,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,26,Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)
27,27,Ross,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,27,"No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?"
28,28,Phoebe,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,28,Fine!  Be murky!
29,29,Ross,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,29,"I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
30,30,Monica,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,30,No you don't.
31,31,Ross,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,31,"No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
32,32,Joey,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,32,And you never knew she was a lesbian...
33,33,Ross,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,33,"No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
34,34,Chandler,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,34,Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
35,35,Ross,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,35,"I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well."
36,36,Monica,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,36,"Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., ""I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren."" was what?  A wrong number?"
37,37,Ross,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,37,Sorry.
38,38,Joey,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,38,"Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
39,39,Joey,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,39,"Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!"
40,40,Ross,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,40,"I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!"
41,41,Chandler,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,41,And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
42,42,Monica,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,42,Rachel?!
43,43,Rachel,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,43,"Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
45,45,Monica,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,45,"(pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?"
46,46,Rachel,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,46,"Hi, sure!"
47,47,Ross,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,47,Hi.
48,48,Monica,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,48,"So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?"
49,49,Rachel,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,49,"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city."
50,50,Monica,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,50,Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
51,51,Rachel,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,51,"Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... [Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]"
52,52,Monica,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,52,"Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it."
53,53,Chandler,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,53,(imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
54,54,Ross,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,54,(in a deep voice) I'll have whatever Christine is having.
55,55,Rachel,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,55,"(on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!"
56,56,Phoebe,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,56,"If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off."
57,57,Chandler,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,57,"(re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants."
58,58,Joey,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,58,I say push her down the stairs.
60,60,Rachel,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,60,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
61,61,Ross,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,61,You can see where he'd have trouble.
62,62,Rachel,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,62,"Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica."
63,63,Monica,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,63,"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica..."
64,64,Rachel,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,64,"Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
65,65,Monica,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,65,"Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things..."
66,66,Phoebe,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,66,"(sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few..."
67,67,Rachel,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,67,I'm all better now.
68,68,Phoebe,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,68,(grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!
69,69,Monica,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,69,"Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing."
70,70,Joey,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,70,"(comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
71,71,Monica,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,71,"Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!"
72,72,Joey,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,72,"What, like there's a rule or something?"
73,73,Chandler,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,73,"Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound."
75,75,Monica,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,75,"Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!"
76,76,Joey,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,76,Who's Paul?
77,77,Ross,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,77,"Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
78,78,Monica,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,78,Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
79,79,Ross,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,79,He finally asked you out?
80,80,Monica,19,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,80,Yes!
81,81,Chandler,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,81,"Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
82,82,Monica,20,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,82,"Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
83,83,Rachel,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,83,"Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
84,84,Monica,21,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,84,"(to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?"
85,85,Ross,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,85,(choked voice) That'd be good...
86,86,Monica,22,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,86,(horrified) Really?
87,87,Ross,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,87,"(normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!"
88,88,Phoebe,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,88,"What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
89,89,Monica,23,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,89,"Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
91,91,Chandler,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,91,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?"
92,92,Monica,24,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,92,"Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
93,93,Ross,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,93,A wandering?
94,94,Monica,25,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,94,"Change!  Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
95,95,Phoebe,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,95,"Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good."
96,96,Joey,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,96,"Hey, Paul!"
98,98,Joey,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,98,"Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red."
99,99,Monica,26,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,99,"(yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!"
100,100,Ross,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,100,"So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?"
101,101,Rachel,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,101,"Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
102,102,Ross,19,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,102,"Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
103,103,Chandler,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,103,"(deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it."
104,104,Rachel,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,104,"Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
105,105,Ross,20,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,105,"Okay, sure."
106,106,Joey,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,106,"Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
107,107,Phoebe,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,107,"Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
109,109,Phoebe,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,109,"(singing) Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
110,110,Ross,21,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,110,"(squatting and reading the instructions) I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
111,111,Joey,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,111,I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
112,112,Chandler,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,112,It's a beautiful thing.
113,113,Joey,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,113,(picking up a leftover part) What's this?
114,114,Chandler,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,114,I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
115,115,Joey,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,115,Which goes where?
116,116,Chandler,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,116,I have no idea.
117,117,Joey,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,117,Done with the bookcase!
118,118,Chandler,19,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,118,All finished!
119,119,Ross,22,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,119,"(clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
120,120,Joey,19,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,120,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
121,121,Chandler,20,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,121,"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun."
122,122,Joey,20,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,122,"Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
123,123,Ross,23,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,123,You guys.
124,124,Chandler,21,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,124,"Oh, God."
125,125,Joey,21,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,125,You got screwed.
126,126,Chandler,22,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,126,Oh my God!
127,127,Monica,27,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,127,Oh my God!
129,129,Monica,28,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,129,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
131,131,Monica,29,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,131,-leg?
133,133,Monica,30,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,133,"You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
135,135,Monica,31,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,135,"That's right. [Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]"
136,136,Rachel,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,136,"Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
137,137,Ross,24,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,137,I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
138,138,Joey,22,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,138,Shut up!
139,139,Chandler,23,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,139,You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
140,140,Ross,25,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,140,That only took me an hour.
141,141,Chandler,24,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,141,"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
142,142,Ross,26,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,142,"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
143,143,Joey,23,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,143,"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
144,144,Ross,27,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,144,I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
145,145,Chandler,25,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,145,"Stay out of my freezer! [Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]"
147,147,Monica,32,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,147,"What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?"
149,149,Monica,33,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,149,"Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
151,151,Monica,34,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,151,"Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?"
153,153,Monica,35,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,153,"(spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
155,155,Monica,36,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,155,I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
157,157,Monica,37,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,157,Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
159,159,Monica,38,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,159,"(pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
161,161,Rachel,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,161,Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
162,162,Ross,28,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,162,"(scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?"
163,163,Joey,24,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,163,"Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
164,164,Chandler,26,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,164,"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats."
165,165,Joey,25,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,165,Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)
166,166,Ross,29,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,166,"Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)"
168,168,Rachel,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,168,"Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life."
169,169,Chandler,27,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,169,That is amazing.
170,170,Joey,26,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,170,Congratulations.
171,171,Rachel,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,171,"Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
172,172,Chandler,28,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,172,"If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do."
173,173,Joey,27,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,173,"Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that hungry..."
174,174,Monica,39,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,174,"(entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
177,177,Joey,28,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,177,"Morning, Paul."
178,178,Rachel,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,178,"Hello, Paul."
179,179,Chandler,29,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,179,"Hi, Paul, is it?"
181,181,Monica,40,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,181,Stop!
183,183,Monica,41,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,183,We'll talk later.
185,185,Joey,29,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,185,That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
186,186,Monica,42,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,186,"Shut up, and put my table back."
188,188,Chandler,30,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,188,"All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference..."
189,189,Rachel,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,189,"So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
190,190,Monica,43,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,190,"Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff."
191,191,Joey,30,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,191,"Yeah, I'm an actor."
192,192,Rachel,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,192,Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
193,193,Joey,31,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,193,I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
194,194,Monica,44,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,194,"Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park."
195,195,Joey,32,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,195,"Look, it was a job all right?"
196,196,Chandler,31,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,196,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
197,197,Joey,33,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,197,I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)
198,198,Chandler,32,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,198,"You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
199,199,Joey,34,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,199,"You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.)"
200,200,Monica,45,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,200,So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
201,201,Rachel,19,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,201,I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
202,202,Monica,46,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,202,"I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?"
203,203,Rachel,20,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,203,"Oh, yeah."
204,204,Monica,47,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,204,"Well, it's like that. With feelings."
205,205,Rachel,21,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,205,Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
206,206,Monica,48,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,206,Big time!
207,207,Rachel,22,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,207,Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.
208,208,Monica,49,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,208,"I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
209,209,Rachel,23,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,209,"Oh, look, wish me luck!"
210,210,Monica,50,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,210,What for?
211,211,Rachel,24,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,211,I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job things.
213,213,Monica,51,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,213,"Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?"
215,215,Monica,52,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,215,How do you do that?
217,217,Monica,53,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,217,You know Paul?
219,219,Monica,54,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,219,You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
221,221,Joey,35,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,221,(sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!
222,222,Monica,55,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,222,"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?"
223,223,Ross,30,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,223,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
224,224,Monica,56,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,224,I hate men!  I hate men!
225,225,Phoebe,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,225,"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe."
226,226,Monica,57,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,226,Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
227,227,Phoebe,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,227,"All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)"
228,228,Monica,58,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,228,"I just thought he was nice, y'know?"
229,229,Joey,36,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,229,(bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
230,230,Rachel,25,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,230,Guess what?
231,231,Ross,31,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,231,You got a job?
232,232,Rachel,26,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,232,Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
233,233,Chandler,33,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,233,And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
234,234,Rachel,27,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,234,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!"
235,235,Chandler,34,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,235,"Oh, how well you know me..."
236,236,Rachel,28,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,236,"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!"
237,237,Monica,59,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,237,How'd you pay for them?
238,238,Rachel,29,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,238,"Uh, credit card."
239,239,Monica,60,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,239,And who pays for that?
240,240,Rachel,30,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,240,Um... my... father.
241,241,Rachel,31,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,241,"Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want."
242,242,Monica,61,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,242,"C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life."
243,243,Rachel,32,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,243,I know that. That's why I was getting married.
244,244,Phoebe,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,244,"Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time."
245,245,Rachel,33,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,245,Thank you.
246,246,Phoebe,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,246,"You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel."
247,247,Ross,32,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,247,The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
248,248,Monica,62,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,248,"All right, you ready?"
249,249,Rachel,34,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,249,"No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
250,250,Monica,63,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,250,"You can, I know you can!"
251,251,Rachel,35,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,251,I don't think so.
252,252,Ross,33,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,252,"Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
253,253,Ross,34,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,253,"C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,..."
255,255,Rachel,36,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,255,Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
256,256,Monica,64,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,256,Rachel!  That was a library card!
258,258,Chandler,35,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,258,"(as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream."
259,259,Monica,65,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,259,Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
260,260,Monica,66,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,260,"Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?"
261,261,Ross,35,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,261,"No. No, I gotta go home sometime."
262,262,Monica,67,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,262,You be okay?
263,263,Ross,36,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,263,Yeah.
264,264,Rachel,37,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,264,"Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?"
265,265,Monica,68,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,265,"That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody."
267,267,Ross,37,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,267,"Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no-"
268,268,Rachel,38,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,268,Sorry-
269,269,Ross,38,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,269,"No no no, go-"
270,270,Rachel,39,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,270,"No, you have it, really, I don't want it-"
271,271,Ross,39,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,271,Split it?
272,272,Rachel,40,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,272,Okay.
273,273,Ross,40,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,273,"Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
274,274,Rachel,41,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,274,I knew.
275,275,Ross,41,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,275,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
276,276,Rachel,42,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,276,I did.
277,277,Ross,42,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,277,"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?"
278,278,Rachel,43,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,278,"Yeah, maybe..."
279,279,Ross,43,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,279,"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
280,280,Rachel,44,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,280,Goodnight.
281,281,Ross,44,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,281,Goodnight.
282,282,Monica,69,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,282,"See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?"
283,283,Ross,45,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,283,I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.)
285,285,Joey,37,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,285,I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
286,286,Phoebe,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,286,(sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
287,287,Monica,70,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,287,What? I-I said you had a-
288,288,Phoebe,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,288,(sings) What I said you had...
289,289,Monica,71,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,289,(to Phoebe) Would you stop?
290,290,Phoebe,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,290,"Oh, was I doing it again?"
292,292,Monica,72,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,292,"I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt."
293,293,Joey,38,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,293,"Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya."
294,294,Ross,46,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,294,There's an image.
295,295,Rachel,45,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,295,(walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee?
296,296,Chandler,36,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,296,"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?"
297,297,Rachel,46,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,297,I'm just serving it.
299,299,Chandler,37,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,299,"Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)"
301,301,Rachel,47,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,301,"Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the gang.) Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas."
302,302,Chandler,38,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,302,"Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-"
303,303,Monica,73,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,0,"What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it."
304,304,Joey,39,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,1,"Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?"
305,305,Phoebe,19,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,2,"Oh, yeah!"
306,306,Rachel,48,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,3,Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
307,307,Monica,74,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,4,Absolutely.
308,308,Chandler,39,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,5,"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out."
309,309,Ross,47,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,6,"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket."
310,310,Chandler,40,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,7,"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
311,311,Rachel,49,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,8,"Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone."
312,312,Joey,40,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,9,(pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
314,314,Ross,48,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,11,"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?"
316,316,Ross,49,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,13,Does she.
318,318,Ross,50,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,15,"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?"
320,320,Ross,51,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,17,(trying to ignore her) No. No.
322,322,Ross,52,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,19,"Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age."
323,323,Ross,53,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,20,Hi.
325,325,Ross,54,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,22,"You look great. I, uh... I hate that."
327,327,Ross,55,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,24,"Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh..."
329,329,Ross,56,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,26,"Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?"
331,331,Ross,57,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,28,"Why- why are you here, Carol?"
333,333,Ross,58,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,30,Pregnant?!
334,334,Chandler,41,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,31,"Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding."
335,335,Phoebe,20,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,32,...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)
336,336,Monica,75,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,33,(taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?
337,337,Joey,41,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,34,"Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down."
338,338,Monica,76,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,35,Whose little ball of paper is this?!
339,339,Chandler,42,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,36,"Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead."
340,340,Phoebe,21,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,37,"She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!"
341,341,Monica,77,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,38,"Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have."
342,342,Chandler,43,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,39,"Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow."
343,343,Phoebe,22,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,40,"Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way."
344,344,Joey,42,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,41,"Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come."
345,345,Monica,78,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,42,"That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born."
346,346,Chandler,44,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,43,"(looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!"
347,347,Monica,79,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,44,What?
348,348,Chandler,45,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,45,Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
350,350,Rachel,50,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,47,Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
351,351,Phoebe,23,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,48,"Yeah, it's beautiful."
352,352,Rachel,51,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,49,"Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)"
353,353,Phoebe,24,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,50,"No, look, don't touch that!"
354,354,Rachel,52,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,51,"Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder..."
355,355,Monica,80,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,52,"Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!"
357,357,Joey,43,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,54,"Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
358,358,Phoebe,25,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,55,Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
359,359,Chandler,46,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,56,You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
360,360,Rachel,53,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,57,"I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with..."
361,361,Chandler,47,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,58,...Dinah?
362,362,Rachel,54,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,59,"(looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad..."
363,363,Monica,81,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,60,You didn't.
364,364,Rachel,55,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,61,"Oh, I am sorry..."
365,365,Monica,82,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,62,I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)
366,366,Rachel,56,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,63,"Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!"
367,367,Chandler,48,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,64,"Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne..."
368,368,Monica,83,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,65,(puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.
369,369,Chandler,49,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,66,Boys? We're going in.
370,370,Ross,59,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,67,(standing outside the door).....Hi.
371,371,Monica,84,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,68,Wow. That is not a happy hi.
372,372,Ross,60,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,69,Carol's pregnant.
373,373,Phoebe,26,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,70,(while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!
374,374,Monica,85,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,71,W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
375,375,Ross,61,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,72,"Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.)"
376,376,Chandler,50,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,73,"Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?"
377,377,Rachel,57,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,74,"Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?"
378,378,Ross,62,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,75,"Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me."
379,379,Phoebe,27,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,76,She is so great! I miss her.
380,380,Monica,86,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,77,What does she mean by 'involved'?
381,381,Chandler,51,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,78,"I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done."
382,382,Ross,63,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,79,"Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow."
383,383,Rachel,58,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,80,So what are you gonna do?
384,384,Ross,64,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,81,"I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father."
385,385,Joey,44,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,82,".....Well, this is still ruined, right?"
387,387,Monica,87,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,84,Curry.
389,389,Ross,65,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,86,"I- I think they're great! I, I really do."
392,392,Ross,66,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,89,"Aw, Mom..."
393,393,Monica,88,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,90,"I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?"
395,395,Monica,89,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,92,"No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant."
397,397,Monica,90,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,94,"Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?"
398,398,Ross,67,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,95,Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)
400,400,Monica,91,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,97,"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me."
404,404,Monica,92,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,101,What's that supposed to mean?
406,406,Monica,93,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,103,No it's not.
410,410,Monica,94,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,107,"(trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?"
411,411,Ross,68,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,108,"(pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby."
414,414,Joey,45,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,111,"Your folks are really that bad, huh?"
415,415,Ross,69,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,112,"Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done."
416,416,Monica,95,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,113,"Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours."
417,417,Ross,70,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,114,Must pee. (Goes to pee.)
418,418,Phoebe,28,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,115,"Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins."
419,419,Rachel,59,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,116,You're twins?
420,420,Phoebe,29,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,117,"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type."
421,421,Chandler,52,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,118,What does she do?
422,422,Phoebe,30,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,119,She's a waitress.
423,423,Rachel,60,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,120,"All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)"
424,424,Monica,96,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,121,"Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this."
425,425,Chandler,53,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,122,"Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred."
426,426,Rachel,61,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,123,"The lights, please.."
427,427,Ross,71,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,124,...How long was I in there?
428,428,Rachel,62,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,125,I'm just cleaning up.
429,429,Ross,72,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,126,D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
430,430,Rachel,63,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,127,"Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)"
431,431,Ross,73,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,128,"Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?"
432,432,Rachel,64,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,129,Oh.. a little..
433,433,Ross,74,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,130,Mm-hmm..
434,434,Rachel,65,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,131,A lot.
435,435,Ross,75,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,132,Mm.
436,436,Rachel,66,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,133,"So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?"
437,437,Ross,76,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,134,"Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN..."
438,438,Rachel,67,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,135,"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?"
439,439,Ross,77,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,136,Got me.
440,440,Rachel,68,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,137,Remember when we were in high school together?
441,441,Ross,78,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,138,Yeah.
442,442,Rachel,69,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,139,"I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?"
443,443,Ross,79,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,140,"Yes, yes!"
444,444,Rachel,70,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,141,"Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)"
445,445,Ross,80,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,142,Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.)
446,446,Ross,81,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,143,"(entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway."
449,449,Ross,82,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,146,How could I forget?
451,451,Ross,83,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,148,"(they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?"
453,453,Ross,84,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,150,..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
455,455,Ross,85,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,152,"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?"
457,457,Ross,86,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,154,"Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh."
459,459,Ross,87,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,156,"(picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.."
461,461,Rachel,71,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,158,Barry?
463,463,Rachel,72,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,160,(hesitates) Are you sure?
467,467,Rachel,73,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,164,I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
471,471,Rachel,74,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,168,I dumped him.
473,473,Ross,88,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,170,"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?"
475,475,Ross,89,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,172,"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?"
477,477,Ross,90,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,174,Marlon?!
479,479,Ross,91,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,176,...As in Mouse?
481,481,Ross,92,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,178,"Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?"
484,484,Ross,93,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,181,"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?"
486,486,Rachel,75,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,183,"Oh, not much. I-I got a job."
488,488,Rachel,76,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,185,Why are- why are you so tanned?
490,490,Rachel,77,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,187,Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
494,494,Rachel,78,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,191,"Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!"
496,496,Rachel,79,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,193,"Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs!"
498,498,Rachel,80,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,195,And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
500,500,Rachel,81,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,197,Okay..
502,502,Rachel,82,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,199,Wow.
504,504,Rachel,83,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,201,What?
506,506,Rachel,84,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,203,"Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me."
510,510,Ross,94,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,207,Helen Geller? I don't think so.
512,512,Ross,95,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,209,Thank you!
514,514,Ross,96,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,211,"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?"
516,516,Ross,97,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,213,"Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?"
518,518,Ross,98,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,215,"Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm."
521,521,Ross,99,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,218,"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too."
523,523,Ross,100,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,220,"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch."
525,525,Ross,101,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,222,"My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-"
529,529,Ross,102,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,226,"You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now."
530,530,Ross,103,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,227,Oh my God.
534,534,Ross,104,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,231,Well? Isn't that amazing?
535,535,Joey,46,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,232,What are we supposed to be seeing here?
536,536,Chandler,54,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,233,"I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise."
537,537,Phoebe,31,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,234,"You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato."
538,538,Ross,105,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,235,"Then don't do that, alright?"
539,539,Phoebe,32,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,236,Okay!
540,540,Ross,106,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,237,(walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think?
541,541,Monica,97,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,238,(welling up) Mm-hmm.
542,542,Ross,107,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,239,Wh- are you welling up?
543,543,Monica,98,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,240,No.
544,544,Ross,108,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,241,"You are, you're welling up."
545,545,Monica,99,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,242,Am not!
546,546,Ross,109,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,243,You're gonna be an aunt.
547,547,Monica,100,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,244,(pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!
548,548,Rachel,85,1,2,The Sonogram At The End,245,"(on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now."
549,549,Phoebe,33,1,3,The Thumb,0,(entering) Hi guys!
551,551,Ross,110,1,3,The Thumb,2,"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?"
552,552,Phoebe,34,1,3,The Thumb,3,"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'"
554,554,Rachel,86,1,3,The Thumb,5,"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?"
555,555,Monica,101,1,3,The Thumb,6,"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'."
556,556,Rachel,87,1,3,The Thumb,7,Since when?
557,557,Joey,47,1,3,The Thumb,8,"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'."
558,558,Chandler,55,1,3,The Thumb,9,Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
559,559,Phoebe,35,1,3,The Thumb,10,"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'."
560,560,Rachel,88,1,3,The Thumb,11,And everybody knows this?
561,561,Joey,48,1,3,The Thumb,12,Yeah. Cushions the blow.
562,562,Chandler,56,1,3,The Thumb,13,"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."
563,563,Ross,111,1,3,The Thumb,14,"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm."
564,564,Monica,102,1,3,The Thumb,15,"Uh, Ross."
565,565,Ross,112,1,3,The Thumb,16,"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!"
567,567,Chandler,57,1,3,The Thumb,18,"""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"""
568,568,Joey,49,1,3,The Thumb,19,"""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."""
569,569,Chandler,58,1,3,The Thumb,20,"Hey, that was really good!"
570,570,Joey,50,1,3,The Thumb,21,Thanks! Let's keep going.
571,571,Chandler,59,1,3,The Thumb,22,"Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"""
572,572,Joey,51,1,3,The Thumb,23,"""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."""
573,573,Chandler,60,1,3,The Thumb,24,"""Smoke away."""
574,574,Chandler,61,1,3,The Thumb,25,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
575,575,Joey,52,1,3,The Thumb,26,What?
576,576,Chandler,62,1,3,The Thumb,27,Relax your hand!
577,577,Chandler,63,1,3,The Thumb,28,Not so much!
578,578,Joey,53,1,3,The Thumb,29,Whoah!
579,579,Chandler,64,1,3,The Thumb,30,Hey!
580,580,Joey,54,1,3,The Thumb,31,Hey!
581,581,Chandler,65,1,3,The Thumb,32,"Alright, now try taking a puff."
582,582,Chandler,66,1,3,The Thumb,33,Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
583,583,Joey,55,1,3,The Thumb,34,"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette."
584,584,Chandler,67,1,3,The Thumb,35,"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here."
585,585,Chandler,68,1,3,The Thumb,36,"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete."
586,586,Joey,56,1,3,The Thumb,37,Y'miss it?
587,587,Chandler,69,1,3,The Thumb,38,"Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)"
588,588,Monica,103,1,3,The Thumb,39,"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger."
589,589,Joey,57,1,3,The Thumb,40,That's ridiculous!
590,590,Ross,113,1,3,The Thumb,41,Can I use.. either thumb?
591,591,Rachel,89,1,3,The Thumb,42,"(carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!"
593,593,Rachel,90,1,3,The Thumb,44,(leaving to serve others) Good for me!
594,594,Joey,58,1,3,The Thumb,45,"Y'okay, Phoebe?"
595,595,Phoebe,36,1,3,The Thumb,46,"Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank."
596,596,Monica,104,1,3,The Thumb,47,What did they do to you?
597,597,Phoebe,37,1,3,The Thumb,48,"It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-"
598,598,Ross,114,1,3,The Thumb,49,Easy.
599,599,Phoebe,38,1,3,The Thumb,50,- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
600,600,Chandler,70,1,3,The Thumb,51,"Oh, Satan's minions at work again..."
601,601,Phoebe,39,1,3,The Thumb,52,"Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them."
602,602,Joey,59,1,3,The Thumb,53,What are you talking about? Keep it!
603,603,Phoebe,40,1,3,The Thumb,54,"It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing."
604,604,Rachel,91,1,3,The Thumb,55,"Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!"
605,605,Phoebe,41,1,3,The Thumb,56,"Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'..."
606,606,Monica,105,1,3,The Thumb,57,We're with you. We got it.
607,607,Phoebe,42,1,3,The Thumb,58,Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
608,608,Rachel,92,1,3,The Thumb,59,"Chandler, what are you doing?"
609,609,Monica,106,1,3,The Thumb,60,(puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?
611,611,Ross,115,1,3,The Thumb,62,What is this?!
612,612,Chandler,71,1,3,The Thumb,63,"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking."
613,613,Phoebe,43,1,3,The Thumb,64,"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!"
614,614,Chandler,72,1,3,The Thumb,65,And this- is my reward!
615,615,Ross,116,1,3,The Thumb,66,"Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit."
616,616,Chandler,73,1,3,The Thumb,67,"Okay, so this time I won't quit!"
618,618,Chandler,74,1,3,The Thumb,69,"All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)"
619,619,Phoebe,44,1,3,The Thumb,70,"Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!"
620,620,Monica,107,1,3,The Thumb,71,"Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date."
621,621,Rachel,93,1,3,The Thumb,72,This Alan again? How's it goin'?
622,622,Monica,108,1,3,The Thumb,73,"'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun."
623,623,Joey,60,1,3,The Thumb,74,So when do we get to meet the guy?
624,624,Monica,109,1,3,The Thumb,75,"Let's see, today's Monday... Never."
626,626,Monica,110,1,3,The Thumb,77,No. Not after what happened with Steve.
627,627,Chandler,75,1,3,The Thumb,78,What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
628,628,Monica,111,1,3,The Thumb,79,"Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out."
629,629,Rachel,94,1,3,The Thumb,80,"Well, then can we meet him?"
630,630,Monica,112,1,3,The Thumb,81,Nope. Schhorry.
631,631,Monica,113,1,3,The Thumb,82,"I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd."
633,633,Monica,114,1,3,The Thumb,84,"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked."
635,635,Joey,61,1,3,The Thumb,86,"Let it go, Ross."
636,636,Ross,117,1,3,The Thumb,87,"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi."
637,637,Monica,115,1,3,The Thumb,88,Do you all promise?
639,639,Monica,116,1,3,The Thumb,90,(shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
640,640,Joey,62,1,3,The Thumb,91,"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!"
641,641,Ross,118,1,3,The Thumb,92,"Hey, Pheebs."
642,642,Phoebe,45,1,3,The Thumb,93,"'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!"
643,643,Rachel,95,1,3,The Thumb,94,What bank is this?
644,644,Monica,117,1,3,The Thumb,95,Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?
646,646,Joey,63,1,3,The Thumb,97,(shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here!
647,647,Monica,118,1,3,The Thumb,98,"(to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me."
648,648,Monica,119,1,3,The Thumb,99,"Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan."
652,652,Monica,120,1,3,The Thumb,103,"(to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?"
653,653,Monica,121,1,3,The Thumb,104,C'mon!
654,654,Ross,119,1,3,The Thumb,105,"...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him."
656,656,Monica,122,1,3,The Thumb,107,Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
658,658,Rachel,96,1,3,The Thumb,109,And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.)
660,660,Joey,64,1,3,The Thumb,111,Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
661,661,Phoebe,46,1,3,The Thumb,112,"Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!"
662,662,Ross,120,1,3,The Thumb,113,...What shoe?
663,663,Phoebe,47,1,3,The Thumb,114,"From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'"
664,664,Ross,121,1,3,The Thumb,115,...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
665,665,Rachel,97,1,3,The Thumb,116,"What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it."
666,666,Monica,123,1,3,The Thumb,117,Really!
667,667,Chandler,76,1,3,The Thumb,118,"Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)"
668,668,Ross,122,1,3,The Thumb,119,"You know what I like most about him, though?"
670,670,Ross,123,1,3,The Thumb,121,The way he makes me feel about myself.
673,673,Monica,124,1,3,The Thumb,124,Hi.. how was the game?
674,674,Ross,124,1,3,The Thumb,125,Well..
676,676,Monica,125,1,3,The Thumb,127,Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
677,677,Joey,65,1,3,The Thumb,128,Alan.
678,678,Ross,125,1,3,The Thumb,129,"He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-..."
679,679,Rachel,98,1,3,The Thumb,130,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team."
680,680,Chandler,77,1,3,The Thumb,131,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.."
681,681,Monica,126,1,3,The Thumb,132,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
682,682,Ross,126,1,3,The Thumb,133,What?
683,683,Monica,127,1,3,The Thumb,134,"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
684,684,Rachel,99,1,3,The Thumb,135,"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
685,685,Ross,127,1,3,The Thumb,136,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
686,686,Chandler,78,1,3,The Thumb,137,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
687,687,Phoebe,48,1,3,The Thumb,138,"Hey, Lizzie."
689,689,Phoebe,49,1,3,The Thumb,140,I brought you alphabet soup.
691,691,Phoebe,50,1,3,The Thumb,142,"Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)"
693,693,Phoebe,51,1,3,The Thumb,144,"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?"
695,695,Phoebe,52,1,3,The Thumb,146,I know.
697,697,Phoebe,53,1,3,The Thumb,148,"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it."
699,699,Phoebe,54,1,3,The Thumb,150,"Oh, that's fine, no."
701,701,Phoebe,55,1,3,The Thumb,152,"No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks."
703,703,Phoebe,56,1,3,The Thumb,154,"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?"
705,705,Phoebe,57,1,3,The Thumb,156,Okay.
707,707,Phoebe,58,1,3,The Thumb,158,"No, I'm fine."
709,709,Phoebe,59,1,3,The Thumb,160,Huh!
710,710,Ross,128,1,3,The Thumb,161,A thumb?!
712,712,Phoebe,60,1,3,The Thumb,163,"I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!"
713,713,Chandler,79,1,3,The Thumb,164,"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
714,714,Phoebe,61,1,3,The Thumb,165,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
717,717,Rachel,100,1,3,The Thumb,168,It's worse than the thumb!
718,718,Chandler,80,1,3,The Thumb,169,"Hey, this is so unfair!"
719,719,Monica,128,1,3,The Thumb,170,"Oh, why is it unfair?"
720,720,Chandler,81,1,3,The Thumb,171,"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
721,721,Joey,66,1,3,The Thumb,172,...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
722,722,Rachel,101,1,3,The Thumb,173,"Well, I-I could live without it."
723,723,Joey,67,1,3,The Thumb,174,"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?"
724,724,Ross,129,1,3,The Thumb,175,"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
725,725,Joey,68,1,3,The Thumb,176,"Oh, (Imitating Ross) ""you do, do you""?"
726,726,Ross,130,1,3,The Thumb,177,"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
727,727,Rachel,102,1,3,The Thumb,178,"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work."
728,728,Phoebe,62,1,3,The Thumb,179,"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
729,729,Rachel,103,1,3,The Thumb,180,"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on."
730,730,Monica,129,1,3,The Thumb,181,Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
732,732,Monica,130,1,3,The Thumb,183,"Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like."
734,734,Monica,131,1,3,The Thumb,185,"Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing."
736,736,Monica,132,1,3,The Thumb,187,I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
738,738,Monica,133,1,3,The Thumb,189,"No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about."
739,739,Joey,69,1,3,The Thumb,190,Do you have any respect for your body?
740,740,Ross,131,1,3,The Thumb,191,Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
741,741,Chandler,82,1,3,The Thumb,192,"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
742,742,Rachel,104,1,3,The Thumb,193,"(holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you."
743,743,Chandler,83,1,3,The Thumb,194,"Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)"
744,744,Rachel,105,1,3,The Thumb,195,"(to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good."
745,745,Ross,132,1,3,The Thumb,196,If only he were a woman.
746,746,Rachel,106,1,3,The Thumb,197,Yeah.
747,747,Chandler,84,1,3,The Thumb,198,"Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too."
748,748,Ross,133,1,3,The Thumb,199,Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.)
749,749,Monica,134,1,3,The Thumb,200,(entering) Hey. Where's Joey?
750,750,Chandler,85,1,3,The Thumb,201,"Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?"
751,751,Rachel,107,1,3,The Thumb,202,I think he's across the hall.
752,752,Monica,135,1,3,The Thumb,203,Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.)
753,753,Ross,134,1,3,The Thumb,204,(finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go.
754,754,Chandler,86,1,3,The Thumb,205,"(deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now."
755,755,Ross,135,1,3,The Thumb,206,"Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?"
756,756,Phoebe,63,1,3,The Thumb,207,Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
757,757,Ross,136,1,3,The Thumb,208,"Hey, I might!"
758,758,Phoebe,64,1,3,The Thumb,209,"Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb."
760,760,Phoebe,65,1,3,The Thumb,211,"And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!"
761,761,Joey,70,1,3,The Thumb,212,"(dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going on?"
762,762,Monica,136,1,3,The Thumb,213,Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
763,763,Joey,71,1,3,The Thumb,214,Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
764,764,Rachel,108,1,3,The Thumb,215,"Uh, Joey.."
765,765,Joey,72,1,3,The Thumb,216,"Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.)"
766,766,Monica,137,1,3,The Thumb,217,(turns off the TV) Okay..
768,768,Monica,138,1,3,The Thumb,219,"Please, guys, we have to talk."
769,769,Phoebe,66,1,3,The Thumb,220,"Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not."
770,770,Monica,139,1,3,The Thumb,221,"Alright, we have to talk."
771,771,Phoebe,67,1,3,The Thumb,222,There it is!
772,772,Monica,140,1,3,The Thumb,223,"Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan."
773,773,Ross,137,1,3,The Thumb,224,Is there somebody else?
774,774,Monica,141,1,3,The Thumb,225,"No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change."
775,775,Rachel,109,1,3,The Thumb,226,We didn't change..
776,776,Joey,73,1,3,The Thumb,227,So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
777,777,Phoebe,68,1,3,The Thumb,228,"You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair)"
778,778,Monica,142,1,3,The Thumb,229,"Look, I- I could go on pretending-"
779,779,Joey,74,1,3,The Thumb,230,Okay!
780,780,Monica,143,1,3,The Thumb,231,"-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!"
781,781,Ross,138,1,3,The Thumb,232,"Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were."
782,782,Monica,144,1,3,The Thumb,233,I'm sorry..
783,783,Chandler,87,1,3,The Thumb,234,"(sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!"
784,784,Rachel,110,1,3,The Thumb,235,"(tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-"
785,785,Monica,145,1,3,The Thumb,236,I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
787,787,Monica,146,1,3,The Thumb,238,Are you guys gonna be okay?
788,788,Ross,139,1,3,The Thumb,239,"Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time."
789,789,Monica,147,1,3,The Thumb,240,(dubious) I understand.
791,791,Monica,148,1,3,The Thumb,242,"I'm, I'm really sorry."
793,793,Monica,149,1,3,The Thumb,244,Relieved?
796,796,Rachel,111,1,3,The Thumb,247,Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
797,797,Ross,140,1,3,The Thumb,248,Yeah. He could row like a viking.
798,798,Monica,150,1,3,The Thumb,249,(entering) Hi.
800,800,Ross,141,1,3,The Thumb,251,So how'd it go?
801,801,Monica,151,1,3,The Thumb,252,"Oh, y'know.."
802,802,Phoebe,69,1,3,The Thumb,253,Did he mention us?
803,803,Monica,152,1,3,The Thumb,254,He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look)
804,804,Ross,142,1,3,The Thumb,255,"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her forehead.)"
805,805,Chandler,88,1,3,The Thumb,256,...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
807,807,Chandler,89,1,3,The Thumb,258,"(leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!"
808,808,Phoebe,70,1,3,The Thumb,259,(shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
809,809,Chandler,90,1,3,The Thumb,260,"(returns) Yeah, alright."
810,810,Monica,153,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,0,Alright. Phoebe?
811,811,Phoebe,71,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,1,"Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!"
812,812,Ross,143,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,2,"Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?"
813,813,Chandler,91,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,3,"Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever."
814,814,Rachel,112,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,4,"See, there's always one guy. (Mocking) ""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.)"
816,816,Monica,154,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,6,"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?"
817,817,Joey,75,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,7,Probably kill myself!
818,818,Monica,155,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,8,..Excuse me?
819,819,Joey,76,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,9,"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!"
820,820,Ross,144,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,10,"Joey, uh- OMnipotent."
821,821,Joey,77,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,11,"You are? Ross, I'm sorry.."
823,823,Monica,156,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,13,How does she do that?
824,824,Ross,145,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,14,I cannot sleep in a public place.
825,825,Monica,157,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,15,Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
826,826,Phoebe,72,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,16,(waking and startling them) Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
827,827,Ross,146,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,17,"It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again."
828,828,Monica,158,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,18,What's going on with you?
829,829,Phoebe,73,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,19,I got no sleep last night!
830,830,Ross,147,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,20,Why?
831,831,Phoebe,74,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,21,"My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!"
832,832,Monica,159,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,22,"Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight."
833,833,Phoebe,75,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,23,Thanks.
834,834,Joey,78,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,24,"...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here."
835,835,Chandler,92,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,25,You got waaaay too much free time.
836,836,Joey,79,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,26,"(to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you."
837,837,Chandler,93,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,27,"Happy birthday, pal!"
838,838,Joey,80,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,28,"We love you, man. (Kisses Ross)"
839,839,Ross,148,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,29,"Funny, my birthday was seven months ago."
840,840,Joey,81,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,30,So?
841,841,Ross,149,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,31,"So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?"
842,842,Chandler,94,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,32,"Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is half empty."""
843,843,Ross,150,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,33,"Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?"
844,844,Monica,160,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,34,"Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember."
845,845,Ross,151,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,35,Ohhh.
846,846,Joey,82,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,36,What's wrong with the twentieth?
847,847,Chandler,95,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,37,Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
848,848,Ross,152,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,38,"Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover."
849,849,Joey,83,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,39,"The hell with hockey, let's all do that!"
850,850,Chandler,96,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,40,"(trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?"
851,851,Ross,153,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,41,What are you doing?
852,852,Chandler,97,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,42,(stops) I have no idea.
853,853,Joey,84,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,43,"C'mon, Ross!"
854,854,Ross,154,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,44,"Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?"
855,855,Chandler,98,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,45,You got it.
856,856,Rachel,113,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,46,"Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!"
857,857,Phoebe,76,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,47,"I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed."
858,858,Monica,161,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,48,"Wow, you worked in a mine?"
859,859,Phoebe,77,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,49,"I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?"
860,860,Rachel,114,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,50,"God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally(opens envelope)not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that."
861,861,Chandler,99,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,51,"(looking) Oh, this is not that bad."
862,862,Joey,85,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,52,"Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job."
863,863,Ross,155,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,53,"You can totally, totally live on this."
864,864,Monica,162,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,54,"Yeah, yeah."
865,865,Ross,156,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,55,"Oh, by the way, great service tonight."
869,869,Rachel,115,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,59,"Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne all scream and hug each other."
870,870,Monica,163,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,60,(to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
871,871,Rachel,116,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,61,What are you guys doing here?
874,874,Rachel,117,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,64,"(to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!"
876,876,Rachel,118,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,66,(to Joanne) So what's going on with you?
879,879,Phoebe,78,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,69,"(to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They scream.)"
880,880,Chandler,100,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,70,...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes it to Joey.)
881,881,Joey,86,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,71,"Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.)"
882,882,Chandler,101,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,72,We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
883,883,Ross,157,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,73,"Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry."
884,884,Joey,87,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,74,What?
885,885,Ross,158,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,75,Peach pit.
886,886,Chandler,102,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,76,"Yes, Bunny?"
887,887,Ross,159,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,77,"(points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-"
888,888,Joey,88,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,78,-Peaches?
889,889,Ross,160,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,79,"Actually, nectarines, but basically..."
890,890,Chandler,103,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,80,(to Joey) Could've been a peach.
891,891,Ross,161,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,81,"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine."
892,892,Joey,89,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,82,"Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! (They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff."
893,893,Rachel,119,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,83,"So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!"
896,896,Rachel,120,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,86,Okay.
898,898,Rachel,121,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,88,"What? Guys, I'm not."
900,900,Rachel,122,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,90,I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
902,902,Rachel,123,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,92,"Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies."
904,904,Monica,164,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,94,"Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? (She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the contents of the blender into some glasses.)"
905,905,Rachel,124,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,95,What's that?
906,906,Monica,165,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,96,"Weeeell, it's rum, and-"
907,907,Rachel,125,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,97,Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to drink.)
908,908,Monica,166,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,98,"We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.)"
909,909,Phoebe,79,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,99,"Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!"
910,910,Monica,167,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,100,"Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people."
911,911,Rachel,126,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,101,"Oh, God, ask them what they want."
912,912,Monica,168,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,102,"(on phone) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account."
913,913,Rachel,127,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,103,But I haven't used my card in weeks!
914,914,Monica,169,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,104,"That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay."
915,915,Rachel,128,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,105,"They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?"
916,916,Monica,170,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,106,"(pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?"
917,917,Rachel,129,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,107,"Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!"
918,918,Ross,162,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,108,"(squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh."
919,919,Chandler,104,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,109,What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
920,920,Ross,163,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,110,"No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost..."
921,921,Joey,90,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,111,"C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit."
922,922,Monica,171,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,112,You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
923,923,Rachel,130,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,113,"Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?"
924,924,Phoebe,80,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,114,You are just like Jack.
925,925,Rachel,131,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,115,...Jack from downstairs?
926,926,Phoebe,81,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,116,"No, Jack and the Beanstalk."
927,927,Monica,172,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,117,"Ah, the other Jack."
928,928,Phoebe,82,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,118,"Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.."
929,929,Rachel,132,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,119,"Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-"
930,930,Phoebe,83,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,120,"Oh, see, Jack did love the cow."
931,931,Rachel,133,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,121,"But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like..."
932,932,Phoebe,84,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,122,Floopy?
933,933,Rachel,134,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,123,Yeah.
934,934,Monica,173,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,124,"So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy."
935,935,Phoebe,85,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,125,"Oh, like that's a word."
936,936,Rachel,135,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,126,"Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?"
937,937,Monica,174,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,127,...Pheebs?
938,938,Phoebe,86,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,128,"Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question."
939,939,Rachel,136,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,129,"Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?"
940,940,Ross,164,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,130,"Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!"
941,941,Chandler,105,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,131,"(to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks."
942,942,Ross,165,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,132,Pass it! Pass it!
943,943,Chandler,106,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,133,He's open!
945,945,Chandler,107,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,135,"Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!"
947,947,Chandler,108,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,137,(to the receptionist)'Scuse me.
949,949,Chandler,109,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,139,"Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)"
951,951,Ross,166,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,141,"(jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented."
953,953,Joey,91,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,143,"Well, how long do you think it'll be?"
955,955,Ross,167,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,145,"Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys back off) Heyy..."
956,956,Rachel,137,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,146,"I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down."
957,957,Monica,175,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,147,"No, you were right. I don't have a plan. (There's a knock on the door.)"
959,959,Rachel,138,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,149,Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the door.)
960,960,Monica,176,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,150,Phoebe?
961,961,Phoebe,87,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,151,What?
962,962,Monica,177,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,152,Do you have a plan?
963,963,Phoebe,88,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,153,I don't even have a 'pl'.
965,965,Rachel,139,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,155,"(miserably) No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese."
967,967,Monica,178,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,157,(leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
969,969,Monica,179,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,159,"Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?"
971,971,Monica,180,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,161,Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
972,972,Phoebe,89,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,162,And-and a power tie?
974,974,Monica,181,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,164,(staggered) Oh God.
976,976,Monica,182,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,166,"Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the window.)"
977,977,Rachel,140,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,167,"Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?"
978,978,Phoebe,90,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,168,Big Bird's friend.
979,979,Monica,183,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,169,I see pizza!
980,980,Phoebe,91,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,170,"Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She runs up and takes the binoculars.)"
981,981,Rachel,141,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,171,Hello? Who are we spying on?
982,982,Monica,184,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,172,"White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?"
983,983,Rachel,142,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,173,"Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!"
984,984,Phoebe,92,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,174,"Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman."
985,985,Monica,185,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,175,Please tell me it's his mother.
986,986,Phoebe,93,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,176,Definitely not his mother.
987,987,Monica,186,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,177,"Oh, no..."
988,988,Phoebe,94,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,178,"Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.)"
989,989,Chandler,110,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,179,"Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!"
990,990,Monica,187,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,180,Light still out?
991,991,Rachel,143,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,181,Yeah.
992,992,Monica,188,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,182,Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
993,993,Rachel,144,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,183,"Oh please, they're having sex."
995,995,Rachel,145,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,185,"So, whaddya think George is like?"
996,996,Monica,189,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,186,I think he's shy.
997,997,Phoebe,95,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,187,Yeah?
998,998,Monica,190,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,188,Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
999,999,Ross,168,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,189,I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
1000,1000,Chandler,111,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,190,"Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?"
1001,1001,Joey,92,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,191,"He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that."
1002,1002,Ross,169,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,192,"Look, it's just a little more complicated..."
1003,1003,Chandler,112,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,193,"Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?"
1004,1004,Ross,170,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,194,"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
1005,1005,Chandler,113,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,195,Then what?
1006,1006,Ross,171,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,196,My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles the last part)
1007,1007,Joey,93,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,197,What?
1008,1008,Ross,172,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,198,It was my first time.
1009,1009,Joey,94,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,199,With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh.
1010,1010,Chandler,114,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,200,"So in your whole life, you've only been with one(He gets a look too)oh."
1011,1011,Joey,95,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,201,"Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!"
1012,1012,Monica,191,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,202,"Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?"
1013,1013,Phoebe,96,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,203,Uh-huh.
1014,1014,Monica,192,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,204,"Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!"
1015,1015,Phoebe,97,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,205,"Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley."
1016,1016,Monica,193,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,206,What?! You slept with Jason?
1017,1017,Phoebe,98,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,207,You'd already broken up.
1018,1018,Rachel,146,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,208,How long?
1019,1019,Phoebe,99,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,209,A couple hours.
1020,1020,Monica,194,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,210,"Oh, that's nice!"
1021,1021,Rachel,147,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,211,"Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me."
1022,1022,Monica,195,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,212,Excuse me?!
1023,1023,Rachel,148,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,213,Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl.
1024,1024,Monica,196,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,214,"Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!"
1025,1025,Rachel,149,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,215,I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica and Rachel start to squabble)
1026,1026,Phoebe,100,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,216,There he is! There he is!
1027,1027,Monica,197,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,217,Where?
1028,1028,Phoebe,101,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,218,Right- where we've been looking all night!
1029,1029,Rachel,150,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,219,He is so cute!
1030,1030,Monica,198,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,220,"Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"
1032,1032,Joey,96,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,222,Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
1033,1033,Chandler,115,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,223,"I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
1034,1034,Joey,97,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,224,Really?
1035,1035,Chandler,116,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,225,"No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera)"
1037,1037,Ross,173,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,227,Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.)
1039,1039,Chandler,117,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,229,"Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight."
1040,1040,Ross,174,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,230,"Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?"
1041,1041,Joey,98,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,231,"Oh, ah- the kid has it."
1042,1042,Ross,175,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,232,"The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck."
1044,1044,Chandler,118,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,234,"You gotta do it, man."
1045,1045,Ross,176,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,235,"(to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever(to Chandler)can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my puck."
1047,1047,Ross,177,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,237,"'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!"
1050,1050,Ross,178,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,240,(tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist)
1051,1051,Ross,179,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,241,...Now that was fun.
1053,1053,Ross,180,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,243,"(Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right foot red."
1054,1054,Monica,199,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,244,"Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo."
1055,1055,Chandler,119,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,245,Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)
1056,1056,Ross,181,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,246,"Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to bend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively)"
1057,1057,Chandler,120,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,247,"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people."
1058,1058,Rachel,151,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,248,"Oh, okay. Will you take my place?"
1059,1059,Chandler,121,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,249,"Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel."
1060,1060,Rachel,152,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,250,"Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really."
1061,1061,Ross,182,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,251,Green. To the green.
1062,1062,Rachel,153,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,252,(on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens) Never-never mind.
1063,1063,Chandler,122,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,253,"To the left, to the left- aww! (They all collapse)"
1064,1064,Rachel,154,1,4,George Stephanopoulos,254,(on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.
1065,1065,Monica,200,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,0,Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
1066,1066,Ross,183,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,1,"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?"
1067,1067,Rachel,155,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,2,Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
1068,1068,Chandler,123,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,3,"We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."
1069,1069,Joey,99,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,4,"Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me."
1070,1070,Phoebe,102,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,5,"Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care."
1071,1071,Ross,184,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,6,Multiple orgasms!
1072,1072,Chandler,124,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,7,"So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!"
1073,1073,Joey,100,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,8,"No plans, huh?"
1074,1074,Chandler,125,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,9,Not a one.
1075,1075,Ross,185,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,10,"Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?"
1076,1076,Chandler,126,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,11,"Oh, right, right, shut up."
1077,1077,Monica,201,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,12,"Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it."
1078,1078,Chandler,127,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,13,"No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
1079,1079,Joey,101,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,14,"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling."
1080,1080,Phoebe,103,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,15,"You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."
1081,1081,Chandler,128,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,16,"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her."
1082,1082,Phoebe,104,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,17,"No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony."
1083,1083,Ross,186,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,18,Tony?
1084,1084,Monica,202,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,19,"Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?"
1085,1085,Phoebe,105,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,20,"Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know."
1086,1086,Rachel,156,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,21,(waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?
1087,1087,Ross,187,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,22,"Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine."
1088,1088,Phoebe,106,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,23,(to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
1089,1089,Rachel,157,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,24,It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
1090,1090,Ross,188,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,25,"That guy, he burns me up."
1091,1091,Rachel,158,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,26,"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady."
1092,1092,Chandler,129,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,27,"Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that."
1093,1093,Monica,203,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,28,"Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing again?"
1094,1094,Rachel,159,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,29,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own""."
1095,1095,Phoebe,107,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,30,"(rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh."
1097,1097,Joey,102,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,32,"My god, Angela."
1098,1098,Monica,204,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,33,"Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her."
1099,1099,Phoebe,108,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,34,Are you gonna go over there?
1100,1100,Joey,103,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,35,"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) Hey, Angela."
1102,1102,Joey,104,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,37,You look good.
1104,1104,Joey,105,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,39,You don't say.
1105,1105,Ross,189,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,40,"So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?"
1106,1106,Rachel,160,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,41,"Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama."
1107,1107,Ross,190,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,42,"Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?"
1108,1108,Rachel,161,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,43,Who?
1109,1109,Ross,191,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,44,"Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?"
1110,1110,Rachel,162,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,45,Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
1111,1111,Ross,192,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,46,"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?"
1112,1112,Rachel,163,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,47,Sure.
1114,1114,Joey,106,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,49,Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
1116,1116,Joey,107,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,51,"Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too."
1118,1118,Joey,108,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,53,What?
1120,1120,Joey,109,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,55,"Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?"
1122,1122,Joey,110,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,57,"You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica."
1123,1123,Joey,111,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,58,"Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."
1124,1124,Monica,205,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,59,Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
1125,1125,Joey,112,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,60,"Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is..."
1126,1126,Monica,206,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,61,"(looking out window) Oh, god help us."
1127,1127,Joey,113,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,62,What?
1128,1128,Monica,207,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,63,Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
1129,1129,Joey,114,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,64,"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me."
1130,1130,Monica,208,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,65,What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
1131,1131,Joey,115,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,66,"(proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?"
1132,1132,Ross,193,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,67,"(on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
1133,1133,Chandler,130,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,68,"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
1134,1134,Ross,194,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,69,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
1135,1135,Chandler,131,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,70,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
1136,1136,Ross,195,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,71,Nuh-uh.
1137,1137,Chandler,132,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,72,Yuh-huh.
1138,1138,Ross,196,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,73,"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
1139,1139,Chandler,133,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,74,"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?"
1140,1140,Ross,197,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,75,(sheepish) No.
1141,1141,Chandler,134,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,76,"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
1142,1142,Ross,198,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,77,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way."
1143,1143,Chandler,135,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,78,There you go.
1144,1144,Monica,209,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,79,Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
1145,1145,Joey,116,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,80,Yep.
1146,1146,Monica,210,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,81,Which?
1147,1147,Joey,117,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,82,Which what?
1148,1148,Monica,211,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,83,"You've never met Bob, have you?"
1149,1149,Joey,118,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,84,"No, but he's..."
1150,1150,Monica,212,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,85,"Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly..."
1152,1152,Monica,213,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,87,...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
1153,1153,Chandler,136,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,88,Where are they? Where are they?
1154,1154,Phoebe,109,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,89,This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
1155,1155,Chandler,137,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,90,It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
1156,1156,Phoebe,110,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,91,"Eww, I don't wanna do that."
1157,1157,Chandler,138,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,92,Here we go.
1158,1158,Phoebe,111,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,93,"Ok, have a good break-up."
1159,1159,Chandler,139,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,94,"Hey, Janice."
1161,1161,Chandler,140,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,96,"Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?"
1163,1163,Chandler,141,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,98,What?
1165,1165,Chandler,142,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,100,(covering) What... did you get me there?
1167,1167,Chandler,143,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,102,Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
1169,1169,Chandler,144,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,104,That's great.
1170,1170,Chandler,145,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,105,"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
1172,1172,Chandler,146,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,107,That's it?
1173,1173,Phoebe,112,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,108,"Yeah, it was really hard."
1174,1174,Chandler,147,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,109,"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
1175,1175,Phoebe,113,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,110,"Ok, you weren't there."
1177,1177,Rachel,164,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,112,"Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine."
1179,1179,Rachel,165,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,114,But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
1181,1181,Rachel,166,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,116,What?
1183,1183,Ross,199,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,118,What's goin' on?
1184,1184,Rachel,167,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,119,"Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine."
1185,1185,Ross,200,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,120,Was your basket on top?
1186,1186,Rachel,168,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,121,"Yeah, but, there were no suds."
1187,1187,Ross,201,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,122,So?
1188,1188,Rachel,169,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,123,"Well, you know, no suds, no save."
1189,1189,Ross,202,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,124,"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's machine."
1191,1191,Ross,203,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,126,"Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it."
1192,1192,Ross,204,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,127,"(to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry."
1193,1193,Rachel,170,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,128,That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
1194,1194,Ross,205,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,129,"Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent."
1195,1195,Rachel,171,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,130,What's that?
1196,1196,Ross,206,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,131,"Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough."
1197,1197,Ross,207,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,132,"Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?"
1198,1198,Rachel,172,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,133,"Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?"
1199,1199,Ross,208,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,134,"Rach, have you never done this before?"
1200,1200,Rachel,173,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,135,"Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin."
1201,1201,Ross,209,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,136,"Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things."
1202,1202,Rachel,174,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,137,"(holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?"
1203,1203,Ross,210,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,138,"(visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call."
1204,1204,Monica,214,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,139,"(to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow up?"
1207,1207,Monica,215,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,142,"How, how did that happen?"
1208,1208,Joey,119,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,143,Oh my god.
1209,1209,Monica,216,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,144,What?
1210,1210,Joey,120,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,145,I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
1211,1211,Joey,121,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,146,"So, you and Angela, huh?"
1213,1213,Joey,122,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,148,"You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
1215,1215,Joey,123,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,150,"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
1217,1217,Joey,124,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,152,"Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
1218,1218,Monica,217,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,153,"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
1220,1220,Monica,218,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,155,"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight."
1222,1222,Monica,219,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,157,Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
1224,1224,Phoebe,114,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,159,"Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed."
1225,1225,Chandler,148,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,160,"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice."
1227,1227,Rachel,175,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,162,"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."
1228,1228,Ross,211,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,163,"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh."
1229,1229,Rachel,176,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,164,What uh-oh?
1230,1230,Ross,212,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,165,"(not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
1231,1231,Rachel,177,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,166,"Ross, what's the matter?"
1232,1232,Ross,213,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,167,"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
1233,1233,Rachel,178,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,168,"Come on, show me."
1234,1234,Ross,214,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,169,"All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink."
1235,1235,Rachel,179,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,170,"Oh, everything's pink."
1236,1236,Ross,215,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,171,"Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone."
1237,1237,Rachel,180,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,172,"Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!"
1238,1238,Monica,220,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,173,"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?"
1239,1239,Monica,221,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,174,Oh my god.
1240,1240,Joey,125,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,175,What?
1241,1241,Monica,222,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,176,Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
1242,1242,Joey,126,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,177,"Come on, they're close."
1243,1243,Monica,223,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,178,Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
1244,1244,Joey,127,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,179,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
1245,1245,Monica,224,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,180,"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?"
1246,1246,Joey,128,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,181,"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
1247,1247,Monica,225,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,182,"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
1248,1248,Joey,129,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,183,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
1249,1249,Monica,226,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,184,(hits him lightly) Oh!
1250,1250,Joey,130,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,185,Ow!
1251,1251,Monica,227,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,186,(leaving) I'm outta here.
1252,1252,Joey,131,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,187,"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
1253,1253,Monica,228,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,188,Really?
1254,1254,Joey,132,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,189,"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up."
1255,1255,Monica,229,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,190,"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story."
1256,1256,Joey,133,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,191,"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here."
1257,1257,Chandler,149,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,192,"Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom."
1259,1259,Chandler,150,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,194,"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
1261,1261,Chandler,151,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,196,(to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
1262,1262,Phoebe,115,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,197,Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you had?
1263,1263,Chandler,152,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,198,"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
1264,1264,Phoebe,116,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,199,"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la."
1265,1265,Chandler,153,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,200,I'm fine.
1266,1266,Phoebe,117,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,201,All right.
1267,1267,Chandler,154,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,202,I'm not fine. Here she comes.
1268,1268,Phoebe,118,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,203,Wait here. Breathe.
1269,1269,Chandler,155,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,204,How do you do that?
1270,1270,Phoebe,119,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,205,It's like a gift.
1271,1271,Chandler,156,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,206,We should always always break up together.
1272,1272,Phoebe,120,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,207,"Oh, I'd like that."
1273,1273,Ross,216,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,208,You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
1274,1274,Rachel,181,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,209,"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now."
1275,1275,Rachel,182,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,210,"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart."
1277,1277,Rachel,183,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,212,"I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart."
1279,1279,Rachel,184,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,214,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!"
1281,1281,Rachel,185,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,216,"All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!"
1282,1282,Rachel,186,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,217,(to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
1283,1283,Ross,217,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,218,"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
1284,1284,Rachel,187,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,219,I could not have done this without you.
1285,1285,Ross,218,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,220,"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine."
1286,1286,Rachel,188,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,221,Are you sure?
1287,1287,Ross,219,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,222,No.
1289,1289,Rachel,189,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,224,"Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
1290,1290,Ross,220,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,225,Yeah.
1291,1291,Rachel,190,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,226,Does it still hurt?
1292,1292,Ross,221,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,227,Yeah.
1293,1293,Phoebe,121,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,228,(seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
1294,1294,Monica,230,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,229,Hi.
1295,1295,Phoebe,122,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,230,"Hey, how'd it go?"
1296,1296,Joey,134,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,231,Excellent.
1297,1297,Monica,231,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,232,"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves."
1298,1298,Ross,222,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,233,"What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
1299,1299,Monica,232,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,234,"(notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry."
1300,1300,Rachel,191,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,235,Where's Chandler?
1301,1301,Phoebe,123,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,236,"Oh, he needed some time to grieve."
1302,1302,Chandler,157,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,237,I'm free! I'm free!
1303,1303,Phoebe,124,1,5,The East German Laundry Detergent,238,That oughta do it.
1304,1304,Rachel,192,1,6,The Butt,0,"(reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!"
1305,1305,Chandler,158,1,6,The Butt,1,"You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
1306,1306,Phoebe,125,1,6,The Butt,2,"The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!"
1307,1307,Ross,223,1,6,The Butt,3,"Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen."
1308,1308,Joey,135,1,6,The Butt,4,"Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)"
1311,1311,Rachel,193,1,6,The Butt,7,God. I feel violated.
1312,1312,Monica,233,1,6,The Butt,8,"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?"
1313,1313,Chandler,159,1,6,The Butt,9,"(staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock."
1314,1314,Ross,224,1,6,The Butt,10,Is it? Feels like two.
1315,1315,Chandler,160,1,6,The Butt,11,"No, ten o'clock."
1316,1316,Ross,225,1,6,The Butt,12,What?
1317,1317,Chandler,161,1,6,The Butt,13,"(sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!"
1318,1318,Ross,226,1,6,The Butt,14,Oh. Hel-lo!
1319,1319,Chandler,162,1,6,The Butt,15,"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!"
1320,1320,Monica,234,1,6,The Butt,16,"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone."
1321,1321,Chandler,163,1,6,The Butt,17,"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'"
1322,1322,Rachel,194,1,6,The Butt,18,"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!"
1323,1323,Chandler,164,1,6,The Butt,19,"Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here."
1324,1324,Ross,227,1,6,The Butt,20,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
1325,1325,Chandler,165,1,6,The Butt,21,"Thank you, buddy."
1326,1326,Phoebe,126,1,6,The Butt,22,"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys."
1327,1327,Monica,235,1,6,The Butt,23,You could do that!
1328,1328,Chandler,166,1,6,The Butt,24,Y'think?
1330,1330,Chandler,167,1,6,The Butt,26,"Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue..."
1331,1331,Ross,228,1,6,The Butt,27,C'mon! C'mon!
1332,1332,Chandler,168,1,6,The Butt,28,Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
1334,1334,Chandler,169,1,6,The Butt,30,"Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi."
1336,1336,Chandler,170,1,6,The Butt,32,"Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)"
1339,1339,Joey,136,1,6,The Butt,35,Whadja think?
1341,1341,Joey,137,1,6,The Butt,37,"C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head."
1343,1343,Chandler,171,1,6,The Butt,39,"(running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)"
1344,1344,Rachel,195,1,6,The Butt,40,What is it?
1345,1345,Joey,138,1,6,The Butt,41,"The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!"
1346,1346,Phoebe,127,1,6,The Butt,42,Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
1347,1347,Chandler,172,1,6,The Butt,43,"Hey, kids."
1349,1349,Phoebe,128,1,6,The Butt,45,"(reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line."
1350,1350,Chandler,173,1,6,The Butt,46,"Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went."
1351,1351,Monica,236,1,6,The Butt,47,"Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?"
1352,1352,Chandler,174,1,6,The Butt,48,It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
1354,1354,Chandler,175,1,6,The Butt,50,"Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it."
1356,1356,Chandler,176,1,6,The Butt,52,"Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
1358,1358,Chandler,177,1,6,The Butt,54,Who's Rick?
1360,1360,Chandler,178,1,6,The Butt,56,"Oh, so you're divorced?"
1362,1362,Chandler,179,1,6,The Butt,58,"Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
1364,1364,Chandler,180,1,6,The Butt,60,"So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?"
1366,1366,Chandler,181,1,6,The Butt,62,"Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?"
1368,1368,Chandler,182,1,6,The Butt,64,"So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?"
1370,1370,Chandler,183,1,6,The Butt,66,...Hm.
1371,1371,Chandler,184,1,6,The Butt,67,What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
1372,1372,Monica,237,1,6,The Butt,68,"Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?"
1373,1373,Chandler,185,1,6,The Butt,69,"Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!"
1374,1374,Phoebe,129,1,6,The Butt,70,"Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?"
1375,1375,Ross,229,1,6,The Butt,71,"No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is."
1376,1376,Monica,238,1,6,The Butt,72,What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
1377,1377,Joey,139,1,6,The Butt,73,I couldn't do it.
1378,1378,Monica,239,1,6,The Butt,74,"Good for you, Joey."
1379,1379,Joey,140,1,6,The Butt,75,"When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is."
1380,1380,Ross,230,1,6,The Butt,76,"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-"
1381,1381,Ross,231,1,6,The Butt,77,"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know."
1382,1382,Monica,240,1,6,The Butt,78,"We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!"
1384,1384,Ross,232,1,6,The Butt,80,"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-"
1385,1385,Rachel,196,1,6,The Butt,81,Tah-daaah!
1386,1386,Chandler,186,1,6,The Butt,82,Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
1387,1387,Rachel,197,1,6,The Butt,83,"Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for."
1388,1388,Ross,233,1,6,The Butt,84,"Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask."
1389,1389,Rachel,198,1,6,The Butt,85,"Well, whaddya think?"
1391,1391,Monica,241,1,6,The Butt,87,...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
1393,1393,Monica,242,1,6,The Butt,89,How-how did that happen?
1394,1394,Rachel,199,1,6,The Butt,90,"I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table."
1395,1395,Monica,243,1,6,The Butt,91,"Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while."
1396,1396,Phoebe,130,1,6,The Butt,92,(to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
1397,1397,Chandler,187,1,6,The Butt,93,"Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out."
1398,1398,Monica,244,1,6,The Butt,94,"You guys, I am not that bad!"
1399,1399,Phoebe,131,1,6,The Butt,95,"Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!"
1400,1400,Monica,245,1,6,The Butt,96,That is so unfair!
1401,1401,Ross,234,1,6,The Butt,97,"Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!"
1402,1402,Monica,246,1,6,The Butt,98,"Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook."
1403,1403,Ross,235,1,6,The Butt,99,"Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away."
1404,1404,Monica,247,1,6,The Butt,100,Why not?
1405,1405,Ross,236,1,6,The Butt,101,Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
1406,1406,Monica,248,1,6,The Butt,102,I could do that.
1407,1407,Rachel,200,1,6,The Butt,103,"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout."
1408,1408,Monica,249,1,6,The Butt,104,Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
1409,1409,Chandler,188,1,6,The Butt,105,"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood..."
1410,1410,Monica,250,1,6,The Butt,106,STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
1411,1411,Ross,237,1,6,The Butt,107,Monica? You're Mom.
1412,1412,Phoebe,132,1,6,The Butt,108,Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
1413,1413,Joey,141,1,6,The Butt,109,"(on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!"
1415,1415,Monica,251,1,6,The Butt,111,"Well, what's the part?"
1416,1416,Joey,142,1,6,The Butt,112,"Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! ""I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"""
1417,1417,Phoebe,133,1,6,The Butt,113,"Seriously, what-what's the part?"
1418,1418,Joey,143,1,6,The Butt,114,"""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"""
1419,1419,Ross,238,1,6,The Butt,115,"C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?"
1420,1420,Joey,144,1,6,The Butt,116,...I'm his (mumbles)
1421,1421,Rachel,201,1,6,The Butt,117,"..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?"
1422,1422,Joey,145,1,6,The Butt,118,"...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt."
1423,1423,Monica,252,1,6,The Butt,119,(trying not to laugh) Oh my God.
1424,1424,Joey,146,1,6,The Butt,120,"C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!"
1425,1425,Chandler,189,1,6,The Butt,121,"Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness."
1426,1426,Joey,147,1,6,The Butt,122,"Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!"
1427,1427,Ross,239,1,6,The Butt,123,"You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?"
1429,1429,Monica,253,1,6,The Butt,125,"Alright, alright, alright..."
1430,1430,Joey,148,1,6,The Butt,126,Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
1431,1431,Monica,254,1,6,The Butt,127,For what?
1432,1432,Joey,149,1,6,The Butt,128,Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
1433,1433,Monica,255,1,6,The Butt,129,"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there."
1434,1434,Joey,150,1,6,The Butt,130,Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)
1435,1435,Chandler,190,1,6,The Butt,131,Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
1436,1436,Monica,256,1,6,The Butt,132,He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
1437,1437,Chandler,191,1,6,The Butt,133,"C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!"
1438,1438,Monica,257,1,6,The Butt,134,I warned you...
1439,1439,Rachel,202,1,6,The Butt,135,Who is being loud?
1440,1440,Chandler,192,1,6,The Butt,136,"Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
1441,1441,Monica,258,1,6,The Butt,137,"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?"
1442,1442,Chandler,193,1,6,The Butt,138,"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)"
1443,1443,Rachel,203,1,6,The Butt,139,"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?"
1444,1444,Chandler,194,1,6,The Butt,140,"No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)"
1445,1445,Monica,259,1,6,The Butt,141,"Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that."
1447,1447,Joey,151,1,6,The Butt,143,"Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
1449,1449,Joey,152,1,6,The Butt,145,Me?
1451,1451,Joey,153,1,6,The Butt,147,Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is lost.
1454,1454,Joey,154,1,6,The Butt,150,"Well, I'm- I'm showering."
1456,1456,Joey,155,1,6,The Butt,152,"Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here."
1458,1458,Joey,156,1,6,The Butt,154,I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
1459,1459,Chandler,195,1,6,The Butt,155,"God, I love these fingers..."
1461,1461,Chandler,196,1,6,The Butt,157,"No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are."
1463,1463,Chandler,197,1,6,The Butt,159,"Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)"
1465,1465,Chandler,198,1,6,The Butt,161,Don't go.
1467,1467,Chandler,199,1,6,The Butt,163,"(to himself) Too bad, she's leaving."
1469,1469,Chandler,200,1,6,The Butt,165,"Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick."
1471,1471,Chandler,201,1,6,The Butt,167,"What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!"
1473,1473,Chandler,202,1,6,The Butt,169,"I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?"
1475,1475,Chandler,203,1,6,The Butt,171,"Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?"
1477,1477,Chandler,204,1,6,The Butt,173,"Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us."
1479,1479,Chandler,205,1,6,The Butt,175,You.
1481,1481,Chandler,206,1,6,The Butt,177,"Nono, just you."
1483,1483,Chandler,207,1,6,The Butt,179,Lose the other guys.
1485,1485,Chandler,208,1,6,The Butt,181,"C'mon, we're great together, why not?"
1487,1487,Chandler,209,1,6,The Butt,183,"...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'"
1489,1489,Chandler,210,1,6,The Butt,185,"I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish..."
1491,1491,Chandler,211,1,6,The Butt,187,...The second guy.
1493,1493,Chandler,212,1,6,The Butt,189,"Sorry, the first guy runs the lips."
1494,1494,Ross,240,1,6,The Butt,190,"Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?"
1496,1496,Monica,260,1,6,The Butt,192,"Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?"
1497,1497,Joey,157,1,6,The Butt,193,Nope.
1498,1498,Ross,241,1,6,The Butt,194,"No? What happened, big guy?"
1499,1499,Chandler,213,1,6,The Butt,195,"(to Ross) ""Big guy?"""
1500,1500,Ross,242,1,6,The Butt,196,It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
1501,1501,Joey,158,1,6,The Butt,197,I got fired.
1503,1503,Joey,159,1,6,The Butt,199,"Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and..."
1504,1504,Rachel,204,1,6,The Butt,200,"Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell."
1505,1505,Joey,160,1,6,The Butt,201,My mom will.
1506,1506,Chandler,214,1,6,The Butt,202,Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
1507,1507,Joey,161,1,6,The Butt,203,"Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!"
1508,1508,Monica,261,1,6,The Butt,204,Maybe this wasn't your shot.
1509,1509,Ross,243,1,6,The Butt,205,"Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?"
1510,1510,Joey,162,1,6,The Butt,206,"Hard to tell, I was naked."
1511,1511,Phoebe,134,1,6,The Butt,207,"No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'."
1512,1512,Joey,163,1,6,The Butt,208,Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)
1513,1513,Monica,262,1,6,The Butt,209,"I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys."
1515,1515,Rachel,205,1,6,The Butt,211,"Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?"
1516,1516,Monica,263,1,6,The Butt,212,(determined) Uh-huh!
1517,1517,Rachel,206,1,6,The Butt,213,Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
1518,1518,Monica,264,1,6,The Butt,214,"Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her room.)"
1519,1519,Ross,244,1,6,The Butt,215,She is a kook.
1521,1521,Monica,265,1,6,The Butt,217,"(hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.)"
1522,1522,Rachel,207,1,7,The Blackout,0,"Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay."
1523,1523,Phoebe,135,1,7,The Blackout,1,"Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights go out) OK, thank you very much."
1524,1524,Chandler,215,1,7,The Blackout,2,"Oh, great. This is just..."
1525,1525,Rachel,208,1,7,The Blackout,3,"Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!"
1526,1526,Monica,266,1,7,The Blackout,4,"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on."
1527,1527,Rachel,209,1,7,The Blackout,5,"Wow, you guys, this is big."
1528,1528,Monica,267,1,7,The Blackout,6,"(into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs up)"
1529,1529,Phoebe,136,1,7,The Blackout,7,Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. (to Monica) What's my number?
1530,1530,Phoebe,137,1,7,The Blackout,8,"Well, I never call me."
1531,1531,Chandler,216,1,7,The Blackout,9,"Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre."
1532,1532,Chandler,217,1,7,The Blackout,10,"She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!"
1534,1534,Chandler,218,1,7,The Blackout,12,Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
1536,1536,Chandler,219,1,7,The Blackout,14,"Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy."
1537,1537,Joey,164,1,7,The Blackout,15,Hi everyone.
1538,1538,Ross,245,1,7,The Blackout,16,"And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani."
1539,1539,Joey,165,1,7,The Blackout,17,"Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone."
1540,1540,Phoebe,138,1,7,The Blackout,18,"(at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles."
1541,1541,Rachel,210,1,7,The Blackout,19,That had to hurt!
1542,1542,Chandler,220,1,7,The Blackout,20,"Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!"
1543,1543,Chandler,221,1,7,The Blackout,21,There you go!
1544,1544,Chandler,222,1,7,The Blackout,22,You're definitely scaring here.
1546,1546,Chandler,223,1,7,The Blackout,24,"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. (takes phone)"
1547,1547,Monica,268,1,7,The Blackout,25,Hello?
1548,1548,Chandler,224,1,7,The Blackout,26,"Hey, it's me."
1549,1549,Monica,269,1,7,The Blackout,27,(to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
1550,1550,Chandler,225,1,7,The Blackout,28,"Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr."
1551,1551,Monica,270,1,7,The Blackout,29,What?
1552,1552,Chandler,226,1,7,The Blackout,30,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
1553,1553,Monica,271,1,7,The Blackout,31,I have no idea what you just said.
1554,1554,Chandler,227,1,7,The Blackout,32,(angry) Put Joey on the phone.
1555,1555,Joey,166,1,7,The Blackout,33,What's up man?
1556,1556,Chandler,228,1,7,The Blackout,34,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
1557,1557,Joey,167,1,7,The Blackout,35,"(to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)"
1558,1558,Chandler,229,1,7,The Blackout,36,"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
1559,1559,Rachel,211,1,7,The Blackout,37,"Alright, somebody."
1560,1560,Monica,272,1,7,The Blackout,38,"OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table."
1562,1562,Ross,246,1,7,The Blackout,40,That's my sister.
1563,1563,Joey,168,1,7,The Blackout,41,OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
1564,1564,Monica,273,1,7,The Blackout,42,Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
1565,1565,Ross,247,1,7,The Blackout,43,"Pheebs, what about you?"
1566,1566,Phoebe,139,1,7,The Blackout,44,Oh... Milwaukee.
1567,1567,Rachel,212,1,7,The Blackout,45,Um... Ross?
1568,1568,Ross,248,1,7,The Blackout,46,"Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'"
1570,1570,Ross,249,1,7,The Blackout,48,"The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom."
1571,1571,Phoebe,140,1,7,The Blackout,49,"Oh, Rachel."
1572,1572,Rachel,213,1,7,The Blackout,50,"Oh come on, I already went."
1573,1573,Monica,274,1,7,The Blackout,51,You did not go!
1575,1575,Rachel,214,1,7,The Blackout,53,"Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the foot of the bed."
1576,1576,Ross,250,1,7,The Blackout,54,Step back.
1577,1577,Joey,169,1,7,The Blackout,55,We have a winner!
1578,1578,Rachel,215,1,7,The Blackout,56,"I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park."
1579,1579,Ross,251,1,7,The Blackout,57,"Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line."
1580,1580,Rachel,216,1,7,The Blackout,58,"There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course."
1581,1581,Ross,252,1,7,The Blackout,59,Come on.
1582,1582,Rachel,217,1,7,The Blackout,60,"No, he said we were holding up the people behind us."
1583,1583,Ross,253,1,7,The Blackout,61,(sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?
1584,1584,Rachel,218,1,7,The Blackout,62,"I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of..."
1585,1585,Ross,254,1,7,The Blackout,63,"Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated."
1586,1586,Rachel,219,1,7,The Blackout,64,Yeah right.
1587,1587,Ross,255,1,7,The Blackout,65,"It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff."
1588,1588,Rachel,220,1,7,The Blackout,66,(sigh) OK.
1589,1589,Ross,256,1,7,The Blackout,67,"But, um... I don't think that's going to be you."
1590,1590,Rachel,221,1,7,The Blackout,68,You don't.
1591,1591,Ross,257,1,7,The Blackout,69,"Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future."
1592,1592,Rachel,222,1,7,The Blackout,70,Really?
1593,1593,Ross,258,1,7,The Blackout,71,Mmmm.
1594,1594,Rachel,223,1,7,The Blackout,72,You do?
1595,1595,Ross,259,1,7,The Blackout,73,I do.
1596,1596,Rachel,224,1,7,The Blackout,74,"Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)"
1597,1597,Joey,170,1,7,The Blackout,75,It's never gonna happen.
1598,1598,Ross,260,1,7,The Blackout,76,(innocently) What?
1599,1599,Joey,171,1,7,The Blackout,77,You and Rachel.
1600,1600,Ross,261,1,7,The Blackout,78,(acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
1601,1601,Joey,172,1,7,The Blackout,79,"Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone."
1602,1602,Ross,262,1,7,The Blackout,80,"No, no, no. I'm not in the zone."
1603,1603,Joey,173,1,7,The Blackout,81,"Ross, you're mayor of the zone."
1604,1604,Ross,263,1,7,The Blackout,82,"I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to..."
1605,1605,Joey,174,1,7,The Blackout,83,"Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever."
1606,1606,Ross,264,1,7,The Blackout,84,"I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now?"
1607,1607,Joey,175,1,7,The Blackout,85,"Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the room behind them)"
1608,1608,Ross,265,1,7,The Blackout,86,Shhhh!
1609,1609,Rachel,225,1,7,The Blackout,87,What are you shushing?
1610,1610,Ross,266,1,7,The Blackout,88,We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. (everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?
1611,1611,Rachel,226,1,7,The Blackout,89,Ahhhh!
1612,1612,Ross,267,1,7,The Blackout,90,See?
1613,1613,Rachel,227,1,7,The Blackout,91,"Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)"
1615,1615,Chandler,230,1,7,The Blackout,93,"Um, is it sugarless?"
1617,1617,Chandler,231,1,7,The Blackout,95,"Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it."
1618,1618,Phoebe,141,1,7,The Blackout,96,"(singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she writes the lyrics down)"
1619,1619,Ross,268,1,7,The Blackout,97,"(to Joey) OK, here goes."
1620,1620,Joey,176,1,7,The Blackout,98,Are you going to do it?
1621,1621,Ross,269,1,7,The Blackout,99,I'm going to do it.
1622,1622,Joey,177,1,7,The Blackout,100,Do you want any help?
1623,1623,Ross,270,1,7,The Blackout,101,"You come out there, you're a dead man."
1624,1624,Joey,178,1,7,The Blackout,102,"Good luck, man."
1625,1625,Ross,271,1,7,The Blackout,103,Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.
1626,1626,Joey,179,1,7,The Blackout,104,OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)
1627,1627,Joey,180,1,7,The Blackout,105,"Hey, where are you going?"
1628,1628,Monica,275,1,7,The Blackout,106,Outside.
1629,1629,Joey,181,1,7,The Blackout,107,You can't go out there.
1630,1630,Monica,276,1,7,The Blackout,108,Why not?
1631,1631,Joey,182,1,7,The Blackout,109,Because of... the reason.
1632,1632,Monica,277,1,7,The Blackout,110,And that would be?
1633,1633,Joey,183,1,7,The Blackout,111,"I, um, can't tell you."
1634,1634,Monica,278,1,7,The Blackout,112,"Joey, what's going on?"
1635,1635,Joey,184,1,7,The Blackout,113,"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you."
1636,1636,Monica,279,1,7,The Blackout,114,About what?
1637,1637,Joey,185,1,7,The Blackout,115,He's planning your birthday party.
1638,1638,Monica,280,1,7,The Blackout,116,Oh my God! I love him!
1639,1639,Joey,186,1,7,The Blackout,117,(as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.
1640,1640,Phoebe,142,1,7,The Blackout,118,About what?
1641,1641,Monica,281,1,7,The Blackout,119,My surprise party!
1642,1642,Phoebe,143,1,7,The Blackout,120,What surprise party?
1643,1643,Monica,282,1,7,The Blackout,121,Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
1644,1644,Phoebe,144,1,7,The Blackout,122,"Well, he didn't tell me."
1645,1645,Joey,187,1,7,The Blackout,123,"Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing."
1646,1646,Phoebe,145,1,7,The Blackout,124,This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
1647,1647,Monica,283,1,7,The Blackout,125,"No, you are not. We tell you stuff."
1648,1648,Phoebe,146,1,7,The Blackout,126,Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks like I was second to last.
1649,1649,Rachel,228,1,7,The Blackout,127,Hmmm... this is so nice.
1650,1650,Ross,272,1,7,The Blackout,128,"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
1651,1651,Rachel,229,1,7,The Blackout,129,OK.
1652,1652,Ross,273,1,7,The Blackout,130,"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
1653,1653,Rachel,230,1,7,The Blackout,131,Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
1654,1654,Ross,274,1,7,The Blackout,132,"Yes, yes, that's right..."
1655,1655,Rachel,231,1,7,The Blackout,133,"Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)"
1656,1656,Ross,275,1,7,The Blackout,134,What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
1658,1658,Monica,284,1,7,The Blackout,136,(to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
1659,1659,Joey,188,1,7,The Blackout,137,"Sorry, that was wax."
1660,1660,Phoebe,147,1,7,The Blackout,138,"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner."
1661,1661,Ross,276,1,7,The Blackout,139,Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
1662,1662,Rachel,232,1,7,The Blackout,140,During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
1663,1663,Ross,277,1,7,The Blackout,141,(nonchalantly) Yeah?
1664,1664,Chandler,232,1,7,The Blackout,142,"You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself."
1665,1665,Phoebe,148,1,7,The Blackout,143,"(stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?"
1666,1666,Rachel,233,1,7,The Blackout,144,"Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner."
1668,1668,Phoebe,149,1,7,The Blackout,146,(trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
1670,1670,Phoebe,150,1,7,The Blackout,148,Wait a minute. What's his name?
1672,1672,Rachel,234,1,7,The Blackout,150,Bob Buttons?
1674,1674,Phoebe,151,1,7,The Blackout,152,(the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!
1676,1676,Rachel,235,1,7,The Blackout,154,"Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty..."
1678,1678,Rachel,236,1,7,The Blackout,156,"Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)"
1679,1679,Ross,278,1,7,The Blackout,157,(rolling) Lucky sixes....
1680,1680,Rachel,237,1,7,The Blackout,158,"(entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica."
1681,1681,Monica,285,1,7,The Blackout,159,(smitten) Hi!
1682,1682,Rachel,238,1,7,The Blackout,160,And Joey....
1683,1683,Monica,286,1,7,The Blackout,161,Hi!
1684,1684,Rachel,239,1,7,The Blackout,162,And Ross.
1685,1685,Monica,287,1,7,The Blackout,163,Hi!
1687,1687,Rachel,240,1,7,The Blackout,165,(proudly) He doesn't speak much English.
1689,1689,Rachel,241,1,7,The Blackout,167,Look at that!
1690,1690,Ross,279,1,7,The Blackout,168,"(jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
1691,1691,Rachel,242,1,7,The Blackout,169,"Oh... Italy, I think."
1692,1692,Ross,280,1,7,The Blackout,170,"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
1693,1693,Rachel,243,1,7,The Blackout,171,"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!"
1694,1694,Ross,281,1,7,The Blackout,172,"That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him."
1695,1695,Phoebe,152,1,7,The Blackout,173,Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
1696,1696,Rachel,244,1,7,The Blackout,174,"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat."
1697,1697,Phoebe,153,1,7,The Blackout,175,Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
1698,1698,Rachel,245,1,7,The Blackout,176,"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe."
1700,1700,Phoebe,154,1,7,The Blackout,178,(smiling) You betcha!
1701,1701,Chandler,233,1,7,The Blackout,179,"(chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go."
1702,1702,Chandler,234,1,7,The Blackout,180,"Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)"
1703,1703,Chandler,235,1,7,The Blackout,181,"Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking."
1706,1706,Chandler,236,1,7,The Blackout,184,(gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
1709,1709,Ross,282,1,7,The Blackout,187,"(mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah...."
1710,1710,Ross,283,1,7,The Blackout,188,Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
1711,1711,Rachel,246,1,7,The Blackout,189,I have absolutely no idea.
1712,1712,Ross,284,1,7,The Blackout,190,That's... that's classic.
1713,1713,Rachel,247,1,7,The Blackout,191,"(to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!"
1714,1714,Monica,288,1,7,The Blackout,192,"If you want, I'll do it."
1715,1715,Phoebe,155,1,7,The Blackout,193,"I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I won't."
1716,1716,Rachel,248,1,7,The Blackout,194,"God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry."
1717,1717,Phoebe,156,1,7,The Blackout,195,"You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare at her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK."
1718,1718,Rachel,249,1,7,The Blackout,196,"Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd...."
1719,1719,Ross,285,1,7,The Blackout,197,Paolo. Hi.
1721,1721,Ross,286,1,7,The Blackout,199,"Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing."
1723,1723,Ross,287,1,7,The Blackout,201,"Thing, yes. Thing."
1725,1725,Ross,288,1,7,The Blackout,203,"No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um..."
1727,1727,Ross,289,1,7,The Blackout,205,"No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad."
1729,1729,Ross,290,1,7,The Blackout,207,Yeah! Se vice?
1731,1731,Ross,291,1,7,The Blackout,209,So you do know a little English.
1733,1733,Ross,292,1,7,The Blackout,211,Do you know the word crapweasel?
1735,1735,Ross,293,1,7,The Blackout,213,"That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!"
1737,1737,Chandler,237,1,7,The Blackout,215,OK.
1740,1740,Phoebe,157,1,7,The Blackout,218,"Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... (time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the room gets completely dark)"
1741,1741,Ross,294,1,7,The Blackout,219,Thank you.
1742,1742,Phoebe,158,1,7,The Blackout,220,Thanks.
1743,1743,Ross,295,1,7,The Blackout,221,Kinda... spooky without any lights.
1744,1744,Joey,189,1,7,The Blackout,222,(does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!
1745,1745,Ross,296,1,7,The Blackout,223,"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..."
1746,1746,Ross,297,1,7,The Blackout,224,Oh.. oh... oh.
1747,1747,Joey,190,1,7,The Blackout,225,"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica."
1749,1749,Chandler,238,1,7,The Blackout,227,"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life."
1751,1751,Chandler,239,1,7,The Blackout,229,"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."
1752,1752,Chandler,240,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,0,Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
1754,1754,Chandler,241,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,2,"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
1756,1756,Chandler,242,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,4,Yes please.
1758,1758,Chandler,243,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,6,He's a he?
1761,1761,Chandler,244,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,9,"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?"
1762,1762,Rachel,250,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,10,"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be..."
1763,1763,Chandler,245,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,11,You did?
1764,1764,Rachel,251,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,12,"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not."
1765,1765,Chandler,246,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,13,"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?"
1766,1766,Monica,289,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,14,I did.
1767,1767,Phoebe,159,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,15,"Yeah, I think so, yeah."
1768,1768,Joey,191,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,16,Not me.
1769,1769,Ross,298,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,17,"Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did."
1770,1770,Chandler,247,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,18,You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
1771,1771,Ross,299,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,19,"No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."
1772,1772,Chandler,248,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,20,"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?"
1773,1773,Phoebe,160,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,21,"I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."
1774,1774,Chandler,249,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,22,"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
1776,1776,Chandler,250,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,24,WHAT IS IT?!
1777,1777,Monica,290,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,25,"Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality."
1779,1779,Chandler,251,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,27,"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this."
1780,1780,Monica,291,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,28,"Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome."
1781,1781,Rachel,252,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,29,"Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio."
1782,1782,Ross,300,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,30,(to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
1783,1783,Rachel,253,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,31,"Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome."
1784,1784,Monica,292,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,32,"Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana."
1785,1785,Ross,301,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,33,"So, uh, how's she doing?"
1787,1787,Monica,293,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,35,"How-how are you, Mom?"
1789,1789,Monica,294,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,37,What?
1791,1791,Monica,295,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,39,Nothing.
1793,1793,Monica,296,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,41,"She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
1794,1794,Ross,302,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,42,"Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover."
1795,1795,Monica,297,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,43,Oh God!
1796,1796,Monica,298,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,44,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
1797,1797,Ross,303,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,45,"Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants."
1800,1800,Ross,304,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,48,She looks so small.
1801,1801,Monica,299,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,49,I know.
1802,1802,Ross,305,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,50,"Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now."
1803,1803,Monica,300,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,51,"G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)"
1804,1804,Ross,306,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,52,"Bye, Nana."
1805,1805,Monica,301,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,53,Ross!
1807,1807,Ross,307,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,55,"Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite.."
1809,1809,Ross,308,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,57,"She's not- past, she's present, she's back."
1814,1814,Ross,309,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,62,"I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)"
1816,1816,Ross,310,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,64,Now she's passed.
1817,1817,Chandler,252,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,65,"I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?"
1818,1818,Rachel,254,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,66,"(exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair."
1819,1819,Phoebe,161,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,67,"Yeah, you have homosexual hair."
1820,1820,Rachel,255,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,68,"So, um, did she..."
1821,1821,Ross,311,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,69,Twice.
1822,1822,Joey,192,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,70,Twice?
1823,1823,Phoebe,162,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,71,"Oh, that sucks!"
1824,1824,Joey,193,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,72,You guys okay?
1825,1825,Ross,312,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,73,"I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh..."
1826,1826,Phoebe,163,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,74,Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
1827,1827,Ross,313,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,75,"Nono, she's gone."
1828,1828,Monica,302,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,76,We checked. A lot.
1829,1829,Phoebe,164,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,77,"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her."
1830,1830,Rachel,256,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,78,"Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)"
1831,1831,Phoebe,165,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,79,Thanks!
1832,1832,Rachel,257,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,80,Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
1833,1833,Joey,194,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,81,"Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?"
1834,1834,Phoebe,166,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,82,"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the pencil)"
1835,1835,Ross,314,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,83,I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
1838,1838,Ross,315,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,86,(sarcastic) I don't see why not.
1839,1839,Ross,316,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,87,Here's my retainer!
1841,1841,Monica,303,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,89,Dad!
1843,1843,Monica,304,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,91,You what?
1845,1845,Monica,305,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,93,Define fun.
1847,1847,Monica,306,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,95,"...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun."
1849,1849,Monica,307,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,97,That's probably what they'll say.
1851,1851,Chandler,253,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,99,"Hey, gorgeous."
1853,1853,Chandler,254,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,101,"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake."
1855,1855,Chandler,255,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,103,"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
1857,1857,Chandler,256,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,105,"...Quality, right, great."
1859,1859,Chandler,257,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,107,"Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
1861,1861,Chandler,258,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,109,"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
1863,1863,Chandler,259,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,111,"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
1865,1865,Chandler,260,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,113,Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
1866,1866,Ross,317,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,114,(holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?
1868,1868,Ross,318,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,116,"I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy."
1871,1871,Ross,319,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,119,Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)
1873,1873,Ross,320,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,121,"Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)"
1875,1875,Ross,321,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,123,And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
1877,1877,Ross,322,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,125,"(forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work."
1880,1880,Ross,323,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,128,"No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back."
1881,1881,Ross,324,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,129,Oh my God..
1883,1883,Ross,325,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,131,"Yeah, just... just Nana stuff."
1885,1885,Ross,326,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,133,"(entering) How we doing, you guys ready?"
1886,1886,Monica,308,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,134,Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
1887,1887,Ross,327,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,135,Some days it's all I can think about.
1888,1888,Phoebe,167,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,136,"(entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."
1889,1889,Rachel,258,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,137,"Oh, you-you mean your earrings?"
1890,1890,Phoebe,168,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,138,What'd I say?
1891,1891,Rachel,259,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,139,(sticking her foot out) Hm-m.
1892,1892,Monica,309,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,140,Are these the shoes?
1893,1893,Rachel,260,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,141,Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
1894,1894,Ross,328,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,142,"What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?"
1895,1895,Joey,195,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,143,(entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?
1896,1896,Chandler,261,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,144,"Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?"
1897,1897,Monica,310,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,145,It was a really beautiful service.
1899,1899,Joey,196,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,147,What?
1900,1900,Chandler,262,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,148,"Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger."
1901,1901,Joey,197,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,149,"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)"
1902,1902,Chandler,263,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,150,You're watching a football game at a funeral?
1903,1903,Joey,198,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,151,"No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception."
1904,1904,Chandler,264,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,152,"You are a frightening, frightening man."
1905,1905,Rachel,261,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,153,Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
1906,1906,Ross,329,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,154,"Oh, I hope they're not ruined."
1907,1907,Phoebe,169,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,155,"God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!"
1908,1908,Ross,330,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,156,"I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave)"
1910,1910,Ross,331,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,158,I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
1911,1911,Phoebe,170,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,159,"Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh."
1912,1912,Ross,332,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,160,"What, what is it?"
1913,1913,Phoebe,171,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,161,You missed a belt loop.
1914,1914,Ross,333,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,162,Oh! No-n-
1915,1915,Phoebe,172,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,163,"Okay, it's in spasm."
1917,1917,Chandler,265,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,165,"Oh, no-"
1919,1919,Chandler,266,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,167,"Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is."
1920,1920,Phoebe,173,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,168,"Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?"
1921,1921,Ross,334,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,169,"I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great."
1922,1922,Monica,311,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,170,"Wow, those pills really worked, huh?"
1923,1923,Ross,335,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,171,"Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)"
1924,1924,Phoebe,174,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,172,Ooh! That's so nice...
1925,1925,Ross,336,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,173,...Chandler!
1926,1926,Chandler,267,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,174,Hey.
1927,1927,Ross,337,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,175,"(hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me."
1929,1929,Ross,338,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,177,Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.
1930,1930,Rachel,262,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,178,"(humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?"
1931,1931,Ross,339,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,179,No.
1932,1932,Rachel,263,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,180,You!
1933,1933,Ross,340,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,181,Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)
1935,1935,Joey,199,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,183,"(hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing disability."
1937,1937,Joey,200,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,185,Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
1939,1939,Rachel,264,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,187,"(still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?"
1941,1941,Monica,312,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,189,"Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all."
1943,1943,Monica,313,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,191,That sounds like Nana.
1945,1945,Monica,314,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,193,...I can imagine.
1947,1947,Monica,315,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,195,"That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?"
1949,1949,Monica,316,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,197,"How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example."
1951,1951,Monica,317,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,199,Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
1953,1953,Monica,318,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,201,Huh.
1955,1955,Monica,319,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,203,"Oh, I think so."
1957,1957,Monica,320,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,205,Thank you. They're yours.
1960,1960,Rachel,265,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,208,"Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
1961,1961,Ross,341,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,209,That little naked guy would be me.
1962,1962,Rachel,266,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,210,"Aww, look at the little thing."
1963,1963,Ross,342,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,211,"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?"
1964,1964,Chandler,268,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,212,Who are those people?
1965,1965,Ross,343,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,213,Got me.
1966,1966,Monica,321,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,214,"Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'."
1967,1967,Rachel,267,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,215,"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
1968,1968,Monica,322,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,216,"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
1969,1969,Ross,344,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,217,Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
1970,1970,Joey,201,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,218,"Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
1971,1971,Ross,345,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,219,"(looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something."
1973,1973,Chandler,269,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,221,"Hey, Lowell."
1975,1975,Chandler,270,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,223,So how's it going there in Financial Services?
1977,1977,Chandler,271,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,225,"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not."
1979,1979,Chandler,272,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,227,Really.
1981,1981,Chandler,273,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,229,So- you can tell?
1983,1983,Chandler,274,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,231,"So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
1985,1985,Chandler,275,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,233,He is?
1987,1987,Chandler,276,1,8,Nana Dies Twice,235,"Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian."
1988,1988,Rachel,268,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,0,"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
1990,1990,Rachel,269,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,2,"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
1992,1992,Rachel,270,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,4,"Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that."
1993,1993,Rachel,271,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,5,"Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?"
1995,1995,Rachel,272,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,7,"Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go."
1996,1996,Monica,323,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,8,"Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?"
1997,1997,Ross,346,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,9,"No, they're not."
1998,1998,Monica,324,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,10,"Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them."
1999,1999,Ross,347,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,11,You're wrong.
2000,2000,Monica,325,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,12,I am not wrong.
2001,2001,Ross,348,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,13,You're wrong.
2002,2002,Monica,326,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,14,"No, I just talked to them."
2003,2003,Ross,349,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,15,"(getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom."
2004,2004,Joey,202,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,16,"Hey, hey."
2005,2005,Chandler,277,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,17,Hey.
2006,2006,Phoebe,175,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,18,Hey.
2007,2007,Chandler,278,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,19,And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
2008,2008,Joey,203,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,20,"Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model."
2009,2009,Chandler,279,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,21,"That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman."
2010,2010,Phoebe,176,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,22,What were you modeling for?
2011,2011,Joey,204,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,23,You know those posters for the city free clinic?
2012,2012,Monica,327,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,24,"Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy, healthy, healthy guys""?"
2013,2013,Phoebe,177,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,25,"You know, the asthma guy was really cute."
2014,2014,Chandler,280,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,26,Do you know which one you're gonna be?
2015,2015,Joey,205,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,27,"No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)"
2016,2016,Chandler,281,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,28,"Good luck, man. I hope you get it."
2017,2017,Joey,206,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,29,Thanks.
2018,2018,Ross,350,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,30,"(to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving."
2019,2019,Monica,328,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,31,"Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's."
2020,2020,Ross,351,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,32,Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
2021,2021,Monica,329,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,33,"You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?"
2022,2022,Joey,207,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,34,Yeah.
2023,2023,Monica,330,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,35,"And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays."
2024,2024,Chandler,282,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,36,"Yes, every single one of them."
2025,2025,Monica,331,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,37,"Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?"
2026,2026,Phoebe,178,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,38,"Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar."
2027,2027,Monica,332,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,39,"So you're free Thursday, then."
2028,2028,Phoebe,179,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,40,"Yeah. Oh, can I come?"
2029,2029,Monica,333,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,41,"Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?"
2030,2030,Rachel,273,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,42,"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go."
2031,2031,Chandler,283,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,43,I thought it was $98.50.
2032,2032,Rachel,274,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,44,"Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup."
2033,2033,Ross,352,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,45,"Well, I'm off to Carol's."
2034,2034,Phoebe,180,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,46,"Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?"
2035,2035,Ross,353,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,47,"(mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner."
2036,2036,Ross,354,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,48,"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
2038,2038,Ross,355,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,50,"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in."
2039,2039,Ross,356,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,51,"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum."
2041,2041,Ross,357,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,53,Kinda like a big face without skin.
2043,2043,Ross,358,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,55,"Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian."
2045,2045,Ross,359,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,57,"(picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic."
2047,2047,Ross,360,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,59,"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?"
2049,2049,Ross,361,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,61,"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
2051,2051,Ross,362,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,63,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
2053,2053,Ross,363,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,65,Really?
2055,2055,Ross,364,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,67,"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this."
2056,2056,Phoebe,181,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,68,"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
2057,2057,Chandler,284,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,69,"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head."
2058,2058,Monica,334,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,70,"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?"
2059,2059,Rachel,275,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,71,"No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop."
2060,2060,Monica,335,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,72,"Rach, here's your mail."
2061,2061,Rachel,276,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,73,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
2062,2062,Monica,336,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,74,"(insistently) No, here's your mail."
2063,2063,Rachel,277,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,75,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
2064,2064,Monica,337,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,76,(gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
2065,2065,Rachel,278,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,77,"Oh my god, oh, you guys are great."
2066,2066,Monica,338,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,78,We all chipped in.
2067,2067,Joey,208,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,79,(to Monica) We did?
2068,2068,Monica,339,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,80,(to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.
2069,2069,Rachel,279,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,81,Thank you. Thank you so much!
2070,2070,Monica,340,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,82,"(hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns."
2071,2071,Rachel,280,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,83,"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
2072,2072,Chandler,285,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,84,"All right, I'm nine years old."
2073,2073,Ross,365,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,85,"Oh, I hate this story."
2074,2074,Chandler,286,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,86,"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
2075,2075,Rachel,281,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,87,Oh my god.
2076,2076,Chandler,287,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,88,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
2077,2077,Joey,209,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,89,"Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together."
2079,2079,Joey,210,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,91,"Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?"
2081,2081,Joey,211,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,93,I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
2083,2083,Joey,212,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,95,"I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back."
2085,2085,Joey,213,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,97,"Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?"
2087,2087,Joey,214,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,99,"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?"
2089,2089,Joey,215,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,101,What's wrong?
2091,2091,Joey,216,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,103,Oh. What?
2093,2093,Joey,217,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,105,"Wait, wait, wait!"
2094,2094,Joey,218,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,106,So I guess you all saw it.
2095,2095,Rachel,282,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,107,Saw what?
2096,2096,Phoebe,182,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,108,"No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious."
2097,2097,Joey,219,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,109,Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
2098,2098,Chandler,288,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,110,"Tonight, on a very special Blossom."
2099,2099,Monica,341,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,111,"Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?"
2100,2100,Ross,366,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,112,I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
2101,2101,Monica,342,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,113,"All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping."
2102,2102,Ross,367,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,114,That's closer.
2103,2103,Rachel,283,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,115,"I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop."
2104,2104,Chandler,289,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,116,"Oh, you must stop shooping."
2105,2105,Rachel,284,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,117,"Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff."
2106,2106,Joey,220,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,118,"Chandler, will you just come in already?"
2107,2107,Chandler,290,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,119,"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment."
2108,2108,Phoebe,183,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,120,"Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!"
2109,2109,Chandler,291,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,121,"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore."
2110,2110,Joey,221,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,122,"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."
2111,2111,Monica,343,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,123,That's not a question.
2112,2112,Joey,222,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,124,"But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease."
2113,2113,Monica,344,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,125,"All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots."
2114,2114,Ross,368,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,126,"Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child."
2115,2115,Monica,345,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,127,Ah!
2116,2116,Ross,369,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,128,"Ok, Mom never hit."
2117,2117,Phoebe,184,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,129,"(stirring pot) Ok, all done."
2118,2118,Monica,346,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,130,"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!"
2119,2119,Phoebe,185,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,131,"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions."
2120,2120,Monica,347,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,132,Why would we do that?
2121,2121,Phoebe,186,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,133,"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died."
2122,2122,Monica,348,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,134,"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
2123,2123,Rachel,285,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,135,"Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!"
2124,2124,Chandler,292,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,136,The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
2125,2125,Joey,223,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,137,The balloon?
2126,2126,Chandler,293,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,138,"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?"
2127,2127,Rachel,286,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,139,"I can't, I gotta go."
2128,2128,Chandler,294,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,140,Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
2129,2129,Phoebe,187,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,141,Almost never.
2130,2130,Monica,349,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,142,Got the keys? or Got the keys!
2131,2131,Rachel,287,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,143,Ok.
2133,2133,Ross,370,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,145,"Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..."
2135,2135,Ross,371,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,147,"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid."
2137,2137,Ross,372,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,149,"(quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello."
2138,2138,Rachel,288,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,150,I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
2139,2139,Phoebe,188,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,151,"Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean."
2140,2140,Monica,350,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,152,"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?"
2141,2141,Rachel,289,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,153,We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
2142,2142,Monica,351,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,154,No I don't.
2143,2143,Rachel,290,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,155,"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys."""
2144,2144,Monica,352,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,156,"No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?"""
2145,2145,Rachel,291,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,157,"No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys""."
2146,2146,Chandler,295,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,158,Do either of you have the keys?
2147,2147,Monica,353,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,159,(panicked) The oven is on.
2148,2148,Rachel,292,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,160,"Oh, I gotta get my ticket!"
2149,2149,Joey,224,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,161,"Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key."
2150,2150,Monica,354,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,162,"Well then get it, get it!"
2151,2151,Joey,225,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,163,That tone will not make me go any faster.
2152,2152,Monica,355,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,164,(angry) Joey!
2153,2153,Joey,226,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,165,That one will.
2154,2154,Ross,373,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,166,"And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore."
2156,2156,Ross,374,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,168,"Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?"
2158,2158,Ross,375,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,170,"Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?"
2160,2160,Ross,376,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,172,"Does it always, uh--?"
2163,2163,Ross,377,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,175,"(singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo."
2165,2165,Ross,378,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,177,"(singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts."
2166,2166,Joey,227,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,178,"Nope, not that one."
2167,2167,Monica,356,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,179,Can you go any faster with that?
2168,2168,Joey,228,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,180,"Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math."
2169,2169,Monica,357,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,181,Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
2170,2170,Chandler,296,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,182,(sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
2171,2171,Rachel,293,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,183,"(grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not."
2172,2172,Monica,358,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,184,I swear you said you had the keys.
2173,2173,Rachel,294,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,185,"No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys."
2174,2174,Phoebe,189,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,186,"Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys."
2175,2175,Monica,359,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,187,Why would I have the keys?
2176,2176,Rachel,295,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,188,Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
2177,2177,Monica,360,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,189,But I didn't.
2178,2178,Rachel,296,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,190,"Well, you should have."
2179,2179,Monica,361,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,191,Why?
2180,2180,Rachel,297,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,192,Because!
2181,2181,Monica,362,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,193,Why?
2182,2182,Rachel,298,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,194,Because!
2183,2183,Monica,363,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,195,"Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I..."
2184,2184,Chandler,297,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,196,"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go."
2185,2185,Monica,364,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,197,"Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined."
2186,2186,Ross,379,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,198,"Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's."
2187,2187,Monica,365,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,199,"No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one."
2188,2188,Rachel,299,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,200,"Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys."
2189,2189,Joey,229,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,201,"Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice."
2190,2190,Monica,366,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,202,"Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?"
2191,2191,Joey,230,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,203,You call that delicious?
2192,2192,Monica,367,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,204,"Stop it, stop it, stop it!"
2193,2193,Chandler,298,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,205,Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
2194,2194,Phoebe,190,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,206,Ooh.
2195,2195,Rachel,300,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,207,What?
2196,2196,Phoebe,191,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,208,Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
2197,2197,Joey,231,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,209,I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
2198,2198,Monica,368,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,210,"Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!"
2199,2199,Phoebe,192,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,211,It's nice that he has someone.
2200,2200,Chandler,299,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,212,Shall I carve?
2201,2201,Rachel,301,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,213,By all means.
2202,2202,Chandler,300,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,214,"Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
2203,2203,Ross,380,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,215,I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
2204,2204,Monica,369,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,216,(holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
2205,2205,Joey,232,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,217,"Oh, I will."
2206,2206,Phoebe,193,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,218,"Ooh, you guys have to make a wish."
2207,2207,Monica,370,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,219,Make a wish?
2208,2208,Phoebe,194,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,220,"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?"
2209,2209,Joey,233,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,221,The bigger half.
2210,2210,Chandler,301,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,222,"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked."
2212,2212,Ross,381,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,224,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
2213,2213,Rachel,302,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,225,And a crappy New Year.
2214,2214,Chandler,302,1,9,Underdog Gets Away,226,"Here, here!"
2217,2217,Ross,382,1,10,The Monkey,0,Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
2219,2219,Monica,371,1,10,The Monkey,2,W-wait. What is that?
2220,2220,Ross,383,1,10,The Monkey,3,'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
2221,2221,Monica,372,1,10,The Monkey,4,"No, no, I don't."
2222,2222,Rachel,303,1,10,The Monkey,5,"Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?"
2223,2223,Ross,384,1,10,The Monkey,6,My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
2224,2224,Phoebe,195,1,10,The Monkey,7,That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
2225,2225,Chandler,303,1,10,The Monkey,8,"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"
2226,2226,Monica,373,1,10,The Monkey,9,"Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?"
2227,2227,Ross,385,1,10,The Monkey,10,"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."
2228,2228,Monica,374,1,10,The Monkey,11,Why don't you just get a roommate?
2229,2229,Ross,386,1,10,The Monkey,12,"Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'."
2231,2231,Phoebe,196,1,10,The Monkey,14,"So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman."
2232,2232,Chandler,304,1,10,The Monkey,15,Might wanna open with the snowman.
2234,2234,Monica,375,1,10,The Monkey,17,"So, how'd it go?"
2235,2235,Joey,234,1,10,The Monkey,18,"Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job."
2236,2236,Ross,387,1,10,The Monkey,19,How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
2237,2237,Joey,235,1,10,The Monkey,20,"I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political."
2238,2238,Monica,376,1,10,The Monkey,21,So what are you gonna be?
2239,2239,Joey,236,1,10,The Monkey,22,"Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?"
2240,2240,Rachel,304,1,10,The Monkey,23,"Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?"
2241,2241,Chandler,305,1,10,The Monkey,24,"Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!"
2242,2242,Rachel,305,1,10,The Monkey,25,"Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you."
2243,2243,Phoebe,197,1,10,The Monkey,26,"Yeah, you wish!"
2244,2244,Chandler,306,1,10,The Monkey,27,"It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner."
2246,2246,Chandler,307,1,10,The Monkey,29,"Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm."
2248,2248,Rachel,306,1,10,The Monkey,31,"Phoebe, you're on."
2249,2249,Phoebe,198,1,10,The Monkey,32,"Oh, oh, good."
2250,2250,Rachel,307,1,10,The Monkey,33,"(Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!"
2251,2251,Phoebe,199,1,10,The Monkey,34,"(Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung:)"
2253,2253,Phoebe,200,1,10,The Monkey,36,(Sung)
2255,2255,Phoebe,201,1,10,The Monkey,38,(Sung)
2259,2259,Phoebe,202,1,10,The Monkey,42,"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"
2260,2260,Chandler,308,1,10,The Monkey,43,"(Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!"
2262,2262,Phoebe,203,1,10,The Monkey,45,Could you speak up please?
2268,2268,Phoebe,204,1,10,The Monkey,51,"Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)"
2269,2269,Joey,237,1,10,The Monkey,52,"Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!"
2270,2270,Ross,388,1,10,The Monkey,53,"Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)"
2271,2271,Rachel,308,1,10,The Monkey,54,"Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?"
2272,2272,Ross,389,1,10,The Monkey,55,Just a smidge.
2273,2273,Phoebe,205,1,10,The Monkey,56,"David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical."
2274,2274,Monica,377,1,10,The Monkey,57,I think it's romantic.
2275,2275,Phoebe,206,1,10,The Monkey,58,Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
2276,2276,Rachel,309,1,10,The Monkey,59,Yeah!
2277,2277,Phoebe,207,1,10,The Monkey,60,"Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions..."
2278,2278,Chandler,309,1,10,The Monkey,61,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact."
2279,2279,Phoebe,208,1,10,The Monkey,62,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?"
2280,2280,Chandler,310,1,10,The Monkey,63,"Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
2281,2281,Monica,378,1,10,The Monkey,64,What?!
2282,2282,Ross,390,1,10,The Monkey,65,"C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!"
2283,2283,Chandler,311,1,10,The Monkey,66,"I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped."
2284,2284,Monica,379,1,10,The Monkey,67,"Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!"
2285,2285,Chandler,312,1,10,The Monkey,68,"I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"
2286,2286,Joey,238,1,10,The Monkey,69,"Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late."
2287,2287,Chandler,313,1,10,The Monkey,70,Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
2288,2288,Joey,239,1,10,The Monkey,71,"Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)"
2289,2289,Chandler,314,1,10,The Monkey,72,"Aah, y'killing me!"
2290,2290,Monica,380,1,10,The Monkey,73,Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
2291,2291,Ross,391,1,10,The Monkey,74,"Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
2292,2292,Monica,381,1,10,The Monkey,75,Do you always have to bring him here?
2293,2293,Ross,392,1,10,The Monkey,76,"I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces..."
2294,2294,Chandler,315,1,10,The Monkey,77,"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
2295,2295,Ross,393,1,10,The Monkey,78,"Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
2296,2296,Chandler,316,1,10,The Monkey,79,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
2298,2298,Phoebe,209,1,10,The Monkey,81,"Okay, alright, I have a question, then."
2300,2300,Phoebe,210,1,10,The Monkey,83,"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?"
2302,2302,Phoebe,211,1,10,The Monkey,85,Sure.
2304,2304,Phoebe,212,1,10,The Monkey,87,"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body."
2306,2306,Phoebe,213,1,10,The Monkey,89,"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me."
2308,2308,Phoebe,214,1,10,The Monkey,91,"Oh yeah, right now."
2310,2310,Phoebe,215,1,10,The Monkey,93,"Okay, now you're just kinda tidying."
2312,2312,Phoebe,216,1,10,The Monkey,95,I can hop. (She hops onto the table)
2313,2313,Ross,394,1,10,The Monkey,96,So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
2314,2314,Monica,382,1,10,The Monkey,97,"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
2315,2315,Chandler,317,1,10,The Monkey,98,Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
2316,2316,Monica,383,1,10,The Monkey,99,Yeah.
2317,2317,Joey,240,1,10,The Monkey,100,You know more than one Fun Bobby?
2318,2318,Chandler,318,1,10,The Monkey,101,I happen to know a Fun Bob.
2319,2319,Rachel,310,1,10,The Monkey,102,"(Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go..."
2320,2320,Joey,241,1,10,The Monkey,103,"Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"
2321,2321,Rachel,311,1,10,The Monkey,104,(Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.
2322,2322,Ross,395,1,10,The Monkey,105,"Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates."
2323,2323,Joey,242,1,10,The Monkey,106,"Uh, four."
2324,2324,Ross,396,1,10,The Monkey,107,Four.
2325,2325,Rachel,312,1,10,The Monkey,108,Five.
2326,2326,Ross,397,1,10,The Monkey,109,Five. (Buries his head in his hands)
2327,2327,Rachel,313,1,10,The Monkey,110,Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
2328,2328,Joey,243,1,10,The Monkey,111,"Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?"
2329,2329,Ross,398,1,10,The Monkey,112,"Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?"
2330,2330,Rachel,314,1,10,The Monkey,113,"Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who."
2331,2331,Ross,399,1,10,The Monkey,114,"Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now."
2332,2332,Monica,384,1,10,The Monkey,115,What's the matter?
2333,2333,Ross,400,1,10,The Monkey,116,"Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands..."
2334,2334,Chandler,319,1,10,The Monkey,117,"That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."
2335,2335,Ross,401,1,10,The Monkey,118,Really.
2336,2336,Chandler,320,1,10,The Monkey,119,"Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing."
2337,2337,Ross,402,1,10,The Monkey,120,"What, uh... what juggling thing?"
2338,2338,Chandler,321,1,10,The Monkey,121,With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
2339,2339,Ross,403,1,10,The Monkey,122,No.
2340,2340,Chandler,322,1,10,The Monkey,123,"Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon..."
2342,2342,Phoebe,217,1,10,The Monkey,125,"Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?"
2344,2344,Phoebe,218,1,10,The Monkey,127,"No, no, he hasn't been around."
2346,2346,Phoebe,219,1,10,The Monkey,129,Minsk?
2348,2348,Phoebe,220,1,10,The Monkey,131,I know where Minsk is.
2350,2350,Phoebe,221,1,10,The Monkey,133,"So when, when do you leave?"
2353,2353,Phoebe,222,1,10,The Monkey,136,Hello?
2355,2355,Phoebe,223,1,10,The Monkey,138,Hi.
2357,2357,Phoebe,224,1,10,The Monkey,140,"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! This is so exciting!"
2359,2359,Phoebe,225,1,10,The Monkey,142,"Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?"
2362,2362,Phoebe,226,1,10,The Monkey,145,So-so you're really not going?
2364,2364,Phoebe,227,1,10,The Monkey,147,Oh don't do that.
2366,2366,Phoebe,228,1,10,The Monkey,149,Oh no no.
2368,2368,Phoebe,229,1,10,The Monkey,151,"Oh, but I can't do that-"
2370,2370,Phoebe,230,1,10,The Monkey,153,"It's your thing, and-"
2372,2372,Phoebe,231,1,10,The Monkey,155,"Okay, um, stay."
2374,2374,Phoebe,232,1,10,The Monkey,157,Stay.
2375,2375,Phoebe,233,1,10,The Monkey,158,Getting so good at that! (She hops on)
2378,2378,Chandler,323,1,10,The Monkey,161,You remember Janice.
2379,2379,Monica,385,1,10,The Monkey,162,Vividly.
2380,2380,Monica,386,1,10,The Monkey,163,Hi.
2382,2382,Joey,244,1,10,The Monkey,165,"Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...You brought your kids."
2384,2384,Ross,404,1,10,The Monkey,167,Par-tay!
2385,2385,Monica,387,1,10,The Monkey,168,That thing is not coming in here.
2386,2386,Ross,405,1,10,The Monkey,169,"'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?"
2387,2387,Monica,388,1,10,The Monkey,170,I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
2388,2388,Ross,406,1,10,The Monkey,171,Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
2389,2389,Monica,389,1,10,The Monkey,172,Alright. Just keep him away from me.
2390,2390,Ross,407,1,10,The Monkey,173,"Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later."
2391,2391,Monica,390,1,10,The Monkey,174,"Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?"
2392,2392,Rachel,315,1,10,The Monkey,175,Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
2393,2393,Phoebe,234,1,10,The Monkey,176,And then... your face is bloated?
2394,2394,Rachel,316,1,10,The Monkey,177,"No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?"
2396,2396,Joey,245,1,10,The Monkey,179,"Wow, that's, uh, dirty."
2398,2398,Joey,246,1,10,The Monkey,181,"Hey, kids..."
2399,2399,Ross,408,1,10,The Monkey,182,"(Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in."
2401,2401,Chandler,324,1,10,The Monkey,184,(Imitating) But you found me!
2403,2403,Chandler,325,1,10,The Monkey,186,Kill me. Kill me now.
2404,2404,Monica,391,1,10,The Monkey,187,Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
2406,2406,Joey,247,1,10,The Monkey,189,(Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
2409,2409,Chandler,326,1,10,The Monkey,192,"Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"
2411,2411,Chandler,327,1,10,The Monkey,194,I'm sorry you misunderstood...
2413,2413,Chandler,328,1,10,The Monkey,196,"Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)"
2414,2414,Phoebe,235,1,10,The Monkey,197,"Hi, Max!"
2418,2418,Phoebe,236,1,10,The Monkey,201,Are you alright?
2420,2420,Phoebe,237,1,10,The Monkey,203,You're going to Minsk.
2422,2422,Phoebe,238,1,10,The Monkey,205,"Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me."
2424,2424,Phoebe,239,1,10,The Monkey,207,"Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'."
2426,2426,Phoebe,240,1,10,The Monkey,209,"Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me."
2428,2428,Phoebe,241,1,10,The Monkey,211,And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
2430,2430,Joey,248,1,10,The Monkey,213,"There y'go, kids."
2431,2431,Chandler,329,1,10,The Monkey,214,(To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)
2432,2432,Joey,249,1,10,The Monkey,215,You seen Sandy?
2433,2433,Chandler,330,1,10,The Monkey,216,"Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you."
2434,2434,Rachel,317,1,10,The Monkey,217,"Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing."
2436,2436,Rachel,318,1,10,The Monkey,219,The bll is drrbing!
2438,2438,Chandler,331,1,10,The Monkey,221,And the moment of joy is upon us.
2439,2439,Joey,250,1,10,The Monkey,222,Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
2440,2440,Phoebe,242,1,10,The Monkey,223,Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
2441,2441,Monica,392,1,10,The Monkey,224,Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
2442,2442,Chandler,332,1,10,The Monkey,225,"Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)"
2443,2443,Phoebe,243,1,10,The Monkey,226,I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
2444,2444,Rachel,319,1,10,The Monkey,227,I can't kiss anyone.
2445,2445,Monica,393,1,10,The Monkey,228,So I'm kissing everyone?
2446,2446,Joey,251,1,10,The Monkey,229,"Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother."
2447,2447,Ross,409,1,10,The Monkey,230,Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
2448,2448,Chandler,333,1,10,The Monkey,231,"Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!"
2449,2449,Joey,252,1,10,The Monkey,232,Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.
2451,2451,Ross,410,1,10,The Monkey,234,"(Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back."
2452,2452,Rachel,320,1,10,The Monkey,235,...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
2453,2453,Phoebe,244,1,11,Mrs. Bing,0,Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
2454,2454,Monica,394,1,11,Mrs. Bing,1,Why?
2455,2455,Phoebe,245,1,11,Mrs. Bing,2,"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
2456,2456,Monica,395,1,11,Mrs. Bing,3,"Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression."
2457,2457,Phoebe,246,1,11,Mrs. Bing,4,"Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma."
2458,2458,Monica,396,1,11,Mrs. Bing,5,"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
2461,2461,Phoebe,247,1,11,Mrs. Bing,8,We should do something. Whistle.
2462,2462,Monica,397,1,11,Mrs. Bing,9,We are not going to whistle.
2463,2463,Phoebe,248,1,11,Mrs. Bing,10,"Come on, do it."
2464,2464,Monica,398,1,11,Mrs. Bing,11,No!
2465,2465,Phoebe,249,1,11,Mrs. Bing,12,Do it!
2466,2466,Monica,399,1,11,Mrs. Bing,13,No!
2467,2467,Phoebe,250,1,11,Mrs. Bing,14,Do it do it do it!
2468,2468,Monica,400,1,11,Mrs. Bing,15,(Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!
2469,2469,Phoebe,251,1,11,Mrs. Bing,16,I can't believe you did that!
2471,2471,Monica,401,1,11,Mrs. Bing,18,"Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?"
2472,2472,Phoebe,252,1,11,Mrs. Bing,19,"I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!"
2473,2473,Monica,402,1,11,Mrs. Bing,20,"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
2474,2474,Phoebe,253,1,11,Mrs. Bing,21,Maybe nobody's tried this.
2475,2475,Monica,403,1,11,Mrs. Bing,22,"I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer."
2476,2476,Phoebe,254,1,11,Mrs. Bing,23,"Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic."
2477,2477,Monica,404,1,11,Mrs. Bing,24,"Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!"
2478,2478,Phoebe,255,1,11,Mrs. Bing,25,"Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked."
2479,2479,Monica,405,1,11,Mrs. Bing,26,I wish all guys could be like him.
2480,2480,Phoebe,256,1,11,Mrs. Bing,27,I know.
2481,2481,Chandler,334,1,11,Mrs. Bing,28,Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
2482,2482,Monica,406,1,11,Mrs. Bing,29,He doesn't have anyone.
2483,2483,Phoebe,257,1,11,Mrs. Bing,30,"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible."
2484,2484,Joey,253,1,11,Mrs. Bing,31,I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
2485,2485,Rachel,321,1,11,Mrs. Bing,32,"Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)"
2487,2487,Chandler,335,1,11,Mrs. Bing,34,"Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax."
2488,2488,Rachel,322,1,11,Mrs. Bing,35,"No way, forget it."
2489,2489,Joey,254,1,11,Mrs. Bing,36,"C'mon, she's your mom!"
2490,2490,Chandler,336,1,11,Mrs. Bing,37,"Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?"
2491,2491,Rachel,323,1,11,Mrs. Bing,38,"Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!"
2492,2492,Chandler,337,1,11,Mrs. Bing,39,"Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
2493,2493,Ross,411,1,11,Mrs. Bing,40,"C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast."
2494,2494,Chandler,338,1,11,Mrs. Bing,41,You can say that because she's not your mom.
2495,2495,Ross,412,1,11,Mrs. Bing,42,"Oh, please..."
2497,2497,Rachel,324,1,11,Mrs. Bing,44,"Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)"
2498,2498,Ross,413,1,11,Mrs. Bing,45,When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
2499,2499,Monica,407,1,11,Mrs. Bing,46,Last night.
2500,2500,Ross,414,1,11,Mrs. Bing,47,"Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew."
2501,2501,Phoebe,258,1,11,Mrs. Bing,48,Hey hey hey! She's on!
2504,2504,Phoebe,259,1,11,Mrs. Bing,51,Your mom was arrested?
2505,2505,Chandler,339,1,11,Mrs. Bing,52,"Shhh, busy beaming with pride."
2507,2507,Chandler,340,1,11,Mrs. Bing,54,Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
2510,2510,Chandler,341,1,11,Mrs. Bing,57,THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
2514,2514,Chandler,342,1,11,Mrs. Bing,61,This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
2517,2517,Chandler,343,1,11,Mrs. Bing,64,...And then he burst into flames.
2518,2518,Monica,408,1,11,Mrs. Bing,65,"Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports."
2519,2519,Phoebe,260,1,11,Mrs. Bing,66,What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
2520,2520,Monica,409,1,11,Mrs. Bing,67,Nah... not-not special enough.
2521,2521,Phoebe,261,1,11,Mrs. Bing,68,Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
2522,2522,Monica,410,1,11,Mrs. Bing,69,Waaay too special.
2524,2524,Chandler,344,1,11,Mrs. Bing,71,Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
2526,2526,Chandler,345,1,11,Mrs. Bing,73,"Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little."
2527,2527,Ross,415,1,11,Mrs. Bing,74,(Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
2529,2529,Chandler,346,1,11,Mrs. Bing,76,I know I am.
2531,2531,Monica,411,1,11,Mrs. Bing,78,Yeah.
2532,2532,Phoebe,262,1,11,Mrs. Bing,79,I'm in.
2534,2534,Ross,416,1,11,Mrs. Bing,81,"Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy."
2535,2535,Rachel,325,1,11,Mrs. Bing,82,"Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time."
2536,2536,Ross,417,1,11,Mrs. Bing,83,...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)
2537,2537,Ross,418,1,11,Mrs. Bing,84,Anyone want me to appraise anything?
2538,2538,Rachel,326,1,11,Mrs. Bing,85,"Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer."
2540,2540,Chandler,347,1,11,Mrs. Bing,87,"Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen."
2543,2543,Ross,419,1,11,Mrs. Bing,90,"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one)"
2545,2545,Ross,420,1,11,Mrs. Bing,92,Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
2547,2547,Ross,421,1,11,Mrs. Bing,94,No. It's the one he's licking.
2549,2549,Ross,422,1,11,Mrs. Bing,96,You're good.
2551,2551,Ross,423,1,11,Mrs. Bing,98,The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
2553,2553,Ross,424,1,11,Mrs. Bing,100,When?
2555,2555,Ross,425,1,11,Mrs. Bing,102,The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
2557,2557,Ross,426,1,11,Mrs. Bing,104,Please.
2559,2559,Ross,427,1,11,Mrs. Bing,106,Right.
2561,2561,Ross,428,1,11,Mrs. Bing,108,Uh-oh...
2562,2562,Joey,255,1,11,Mrs. Bing,109,Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
2564,2564,Ross,429,1,11,Mrs. Bing,111,"Hey, is Chandler here?"
2565,2565,Joey,256,1,11,Mrs. Bing,112,Yeah.
2566,2566,Ross,430,1,11,Mrs. Bing,113,"Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?"
2567,2567,Joey,257,1,11,Mrs. Bing,114,Right. No big deal.
2568,2568,Ross,431,1,11,Mrs. Bing,115,Okay.
2569,2569,Joey,258,1,11,Mrs. Bing,116,In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
2570,2570,Ross,432,1,11,Mrs. Bing,117,What code?
2571,2571,Joey,259,1,11,Mrs. Bing,118,"You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!"
2572,2572,Chandler,348,1,11,Mrs. Bing,119,What are you guys doing out here?
2573,2573,Ross,433,1,11,Mrs. Bing,120,"Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept."
2574,2574,Joey,260,1,11,Mrs. Bing,121,"Yeah, well, you don't have your racket."
2575,2575,Ross,434,1,11,Mrs. Bing,122,"No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one."
2576,2576,Joey,261,1,11,Mrs. Bing,123,"Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."
2577,2577,Chandler,349,1,11,Mrs. Bing,124,"Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)"
2578,2578,Ross,435,1,11,Mrs. Bing,125,"Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum."
2579,2579,Joey,262,1,11,Mrs. Bing,126,"Ross, how could you let this happen?"
2580,2580,Ross,436,1,11,Mrs. Bing,127,"I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's..."
2581,2581,Joey,263,1,11,Mrs. Bing,128,You don't think my mom's sexy?
2582,2582,Ross,437,1,11,Mrs. Bing,129,Well... not in the same way...
2583,2583,Joey,264,1,11,Mrs. Bing,130,"I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"
2584,2584,Ross,438,1,11,Mrs. Bing,131,"Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here..."
2585,2585,Rachel,327,1,11,Mrs. Bing,132,Hey.
2586,2586,Ross,439,1,11,Mrs. Bing,133,Hey.
2587,2587,Rachel,328,1,11,Mrs. Bing,134,What're you guys doing out here?
2588,2588,Ross,440,1,11,Mrs. Bing,135,"Well, not playing raquetball!"
2589,2589,Joey,265,1,11,Mrs. Bing,136,He forgot to leave his grip size!
2590,2590,Ross,441,1,11,Mrs. Bing,137,He didn't get the goggles!
2591,2591,Rachel,329,1,11,Mrs. Bing,138,"Well,sounds like you two have issues."
2592,2592,Rachel,330,1,11,Mrs. Bing,139,"Goodbye, baby."
2594,2594,Ross,442,1,11,Mrs. Bing,141,Do they wait for me to do this?
2595,2595,Joey,266,1,11,Mrs. Bing,142,So are you gonna tell him?
2596,2596,Ross,443,1,11,Mrs. Bing,143,Why would I tell him?
2597,2597,Joey,267,1,11,Mrs. Bing,144,"How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."
2598,2598,Ross,444,1,11,Mrs. Bing,145,Oh...
2599,2599,Monica,412,1,11,Mrs. Bing,146,(Entering) What are you guys doing here?
2600,2600,Joey,268,1,11,Mrs. Bing,147,Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
2601,2601,Monica,413,1,11,Mrs. Bing,148,...What did I ask?
2602,2602,Monica,414,1,11,Mrs. Bing,149,Hi.
2603,2603,Phoebe,263,1,11,Mrs. Bing,150,Hi.
2604,2604,Monica,415,1,11,Mrs. Bing,151,What are you doing here?
2605,2605,Phoebe,264,1,11,Mrs. Bing,152,"Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?"
2606,2606,Monica,416,1,11,Mrs. Bing,153,I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
2607,2607,Phoebe,265,1,11,Mrs. Bing,154,"No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
2608,2608,Monica,417,1,11,Mrs. Bing,155,How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
2609,2609,Phoebe,266,1,11,Mrs. Bing,156,"Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)"
2610,2610,Chandler,350,1,11,Mrs. Bing,157,Oh my God.
2611,2611,Ross,445,1,11,Mrs. Bing,158,You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
2612,2612,Chandler,351,1,11,Mrs. Bing,159,I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
2613,2613,Ross,446,1,11,Mrs. Bing,160,"Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
2614,2614,Chandler,352,1,11,Mrs. Bing,161,What?
2615,2615,Ross,447,1,11,Mrs. Bing,162,"I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
2616,2616,Chandler,353,1,11,Mrs. Bing,163,(To Joey) You knew about this?
2617,2617,Joey,269,1,11,Mrs. Bing,164,"Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."
2618,2618,Chandler,354,1,11,Mrs. Bing,165,"I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!"
2619,2619,Joey,270,1,11,Mrs. Bing,166,"Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened."
2620,2620,Ross,448,1,11,Mrs. Bing,167,"Thanks, man, big help."
2621,2621,Chandler,355,1,11,Mrs. Bing,168,(To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
2622,2622,Ross,449,1,11,Mrs. Bing,169,"I wasn't- I mean, I-"
2623,2623,Chandler,356,1,11,Mrs. Bing,170,"Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
2624,2624,Ross,450,1,11,Mrs. Bing,171,I know-
2625,2625,Chandler,357,1,11,Mrs. Bing,172,I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
2626,2626,Ross,451,1,11,Mrs. Bing,173,Chandler-
2627,2627,Joey,271,1,11,Mrs. Bing,174,"Me neither, y'know what-"
2628,2628,Chandler,358,1,11,Mrs. Bing,175,I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
2629,2629,Joey,272,1,11,Mrs. Bing,176,What are you mad at me for?!
2630,2630,Ross,452,1,11,Mrs. Bing,177,Chandler-
2631,2631,Chandler,359,1,11,Mrs. Bing,178,You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
2632,2632,Joey,273,1,11,Mrs. Bing,179,"(Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See what happens when you break the code?"
2633,2633,Ross,453,1,11,Mrs. Bing,180,Joey-
2634,2634,Joey,274,1,11,Mrs. Bing,181,Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)
2635,2635,Monica,418,1,11,Mrs. Bing,182,Hey.
2636,2636,Rachel,331,1,11,Mrs. Bing,183,Hey.
2637,2637,Monica,419,1,11,Mrs. Bing,184,"(Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'."
2638,2638,Rachel,332,1,11,Mrs. Bing,185,"Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?"
2639,2639,Monica,420,1,11,Mrs. Bing,186,"(Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'."
2640,2640,Phoebe,267,1,11,Mrs. Bing,187,(Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.
2641,2641,Rachel,333,1,11,Mrs. Bing,188,Hey.
2642,2642,Phoebe,268,1,11,Mrs. Bing,189,Hello.
2643,2643,Monica,421,1,11,Mrs. Bing,190,Hello.
2644,2644,Phoebe,269,1,11,Mrs. Bing,191,Going to the hospital tonight?
2645,2645,Monica,422,1,11,Mrs. Bing,192,"No, you?"
2646,2646,Phoebe,270,1,11,Mrs. Bing,193,"No, you?"
2647,2647,Monica,423,1,11,Mrs. Bing,194,You just asked me.
2648,2648,Phoebe,271,1,11,Mrs. Bing,195,"Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can we do this now?"
2649,2649,Rachel,334,1,11,Mrs. Bing,196,Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!
2650,2650,Joey,275,1,11,Mrs. Bing,197,"(To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout."
2651,2651,Ross,454,1,11,Mrs. Bing,198,I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
2652,2652,Joey,276,1,11,Mrs. Bing,199,"C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all."
2653,2653,Rachel,335,1,11,Mrs. Bing,200,(Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
2654,2654,Phoebe,272,1,11,Mrs. Bing,201,"Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look) 'Kay. (Sung:)"
2656,2656,Rachel,336,1,11,Mrs. Bing,203,"(Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!"
2657,2657,Chandler,360,1,11,Mrs. Bing,204,What was that?
2658,2658,Ross,455,1,11,Mrs. Bing,205,"Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a..."
2659,2659,Chandler,361,1,11,Mrs. Bing,206,"Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)"
2660,2660,Joey,277,1,11,Mrs. Bing,207,(Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.
2661,2661,Ross,456,1,11,Mrs. Bing,208,"Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips."
2662,2662,Chandler,362,1,11,Mrs. Bing,209,"Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare."
2663,2663,Ross,457,1,11,Mrs. Bing,210,"Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"
2664,2664,Chandler,363,1,11,Mrs. Bing,211,"Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"
2665,2665,Ross,458,1,11,Mrs. Bing,212,(To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.
2666,2666,Chandler,364,1,11,Mrs. Bing,213,That's very funny. We done now?
2667,2667,Ross,459,1,11,Mrs. Bing,214,"No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?"
2668,2668,Chandler,365,1,11,Mrs. Bing,215,"That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."
2669,2669,Ross,460,1,11,Mrs. Bing,216,"Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee) That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!"
2670,2670,Phoebe,273,1,11,Mrs. Bing,217,"Alright, whadyou do with him?"
2671,2671,Monica,424,1,11,Mrs. Bing,218,Oh! You're awake!
2672,2672,Phoebe,274,1,11,Mrs. Bing,219,"Look at you! How, how do you feel?"
2674,2674,Monica,425,1,11,Mrs. Bing,221,You look good!
2676,2676,Monica,426,1,11,Mrs. Bing,223,"Oh, sorry."
2677,2677,Phoebe,275,1,11,Mrs. Bing,224,I'm Phoebe Buffay.
2678,2678,Monica,427,1,11,Mrs. Bing,225,I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
2679,2679,Phoebe,276,1,11,Mrs. Bing,226,"Well, we both have."
2681,2681,Phoebe,277,1,11,Mrs. Bing,228,"Well, actually it's just from me."
2682,2682,Monica,428,1,11,Mrs. Bing,229,I got you the foot massager.
2683,2683,Phoebe,278,1,11,Mrs. Bing,230,You know who shaved you? That was me.
2684,2684,Monica,429,1,11,Mrs. Bing,231,I read to you.
2685,2685,Phoebe,279,1,11,Mrs. Bing,232,I sang. (To Monica) Hah!
2687,2687,Monica,430,1,11,Mrs. Bing,234,"Oh, my pleasure."
2688,2688,Phoebe,280,1,11,Mrs. Bing,235,You're welcome.
2690,2690,Phoebe,281,1,11,Mrs. Bing,237,"What, that's it?"
2691,2691,Monica,431,1,11,Mrs. Bing,238,"""See you around?"""
2693,2693,Monica,432,1,11,Mrs. Bing,240,"Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" Admit something to me? ""I'll call you?"""
2695,2695,Phoebe,282,1,11,Mrs. Bing,242,I don't think you mean that.
2696,2696,Monica,433,1,11,Mrs. Bing,243,"This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe."
2697,2697,Phoebe,283,1,11,Mrs. Bing,244,Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
2699,2699,Chandler,366,1,11,Mrs. Bing,246,"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."
2701,2701,Chandler,367,1,11,Mrs. Bing,248,You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
2703,2703,Chandler,368,1,11,Mrs. Bing,250,Really stupid.
2705,2705,Chandler,369,1,11,Mrs. Bing,252,Yeah. No. No...
2706,2706,Ross,461,1,11,Mrs. Bing,253,"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door."
2707,2707,Joey,278,1,11,Mrs. Bing,254,"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything."
2708,2708,Ross,462,1,11,Mrs. Bing,255,You're kidding.
2709,2709,Joey,279,1,11,Mrs. Bing,256,"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"""
2710,2710,Ross,463,1,11,Mrs. Bing,257,Wow!
2711,2711,Joey,280,1,11,Mrs. Bing,258,"Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"""
2712,2712,Ross,464,1,11,Mrs. Bing,259,"'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"""
2713,2713,Joey,281,1,11,Mrs. Bing,260,That makes more sense.
2714,2714,Ross,465,1,11,Mrs. Bing,261,"So, what's going on now?"
2715,2715,Joey,282,1,11,Mrs. Bing,262,"I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)"
2716,2716,Ross,466,1,11,Mrs. Bing,263,Whaddya see?
2717,2717,Joey,283,1,11,Mrs. Bing,264,"Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!"
2719,2719,Chandler,370,1,11,Mrs. Bing,266,"Yeah, okay."
2721,2721,Chandler,371,1,11,Mrs. Bing,268,Nice save.
2722,2722,Ross,467,1,11,Mrs. Bing,269,(Very politely) Mrs. Bing.
2724,2724,Chandler,372,1,11,Mrs. Bing,271,Hey.
2725,2725,Ross,468,1,11,Mrs. Bing,272,You mean that?
2726,2726,Chandler,373,1,11,Mrs. Bing,273,"Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her."
2727,2727,Ross,469,1,11,Mrs. Bing,274,Yeah? How'd it go?
2728,2728,Chandler,374,1,11,Mrs. Bing,275,Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
2729,2729,Ross,470,1,11,Mrs. Bing,276,"Well, howdya feel?"
2730,2730,Chandler,375,1,11,Mrs. Bing,277,Pretty good! I told her.
2731,2731,Ross,471,1,11,Mrs. Bing,278,"Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go down that road."
2733,2733,Rachel,337,1,11,Mrs. Bing,280,"Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'."
2734,2734,Monica,434,1,11,Mrs. Bing,281,What's a 'niffle'?
2735,2735,Joey,284,1,11,Mrs. Bing,282,You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
2736,2736,Rachel,338,1,11,Mrs. Bing,283,"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
2737,2737,Ross,472,1,11,Mrs. Bing,284,"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
2738,2738,Rachel,339,1,11,Mrs. Bing,285,"Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!"
2740,2740,Chandler,376,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,0,"No-no-no-no, we're done."
2742,2742,Monica,435,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,2,"Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape."
2743,2743,Joey,285,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,3,"Ross, did you really read all these baby books?"
2744,2744,Ross,473,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,4,"Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)"
2745,2745,Phoebe,284,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,5,"Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)"
2746,2746,Chandler,377,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,6,"And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)"
2747,2747,Phoebe,285,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,7,"(softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)"
2748,2748,Monica,436,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,8,"Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?"
2749,2749,Joey,286,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,9,"Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? (measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like voice) Hi Daddy!"
2750,2750,Ross,474,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,10,(waves) Hello!
2751,2751,Joey,287,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,11,(in baby-like voice) How come you don't live with Mommy? (pause; shows Ross less than amused) How come Mommy lives with that other lady? (pause; Ross still looks less than amused; Joey smiling) What's a lesbian? (playfully hits Ross)
2752,2752,Rachel,340,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,12,"Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)"
2755,2755,Monica,437,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,15,"So, did I hear Poconos?"
2756,2756,Rachel,341,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,16,"Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."
2757,2757,Phoebe,286,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,17,"Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!"
2758,2758,Monica,438,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,18,"Yeah, that's a big step."
2759,2759,Rachel,342,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,19,I know...
2760,2760,Chandler,378,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,20,"(to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"
2761,2761,Ross,475,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,21,"Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes flinging motions with hands) flung by now?"
2762,2762,Rachel,343,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,22,"I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally..."
2763,2763,Ross,476,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,23,"...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!"
2764,2764,Joey,288,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,24,"I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands..."
2765,2765,Chandler,379,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,25,"Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!"
2766,2766,Joey,289,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,26,Need a new table.
2767,2767,Chandler,380,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,27,You think?
2769,2769,Ross,477,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,29,"Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna."
2771,2771,Ross,478,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,31,(pauses) I'm pretty sure that it is...
2773,2773,Ross,479,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,33,"(making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?"
2775,2775,Ross,480,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,35,"Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a picture frame)"
2776,2776,Ross,481,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,36,"Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?"
2778,2778,Ross,482,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,38,"(surprised, chuckling nervously) Of course it's your friend Tanya. (looks up frightenedly)"
2780,2780,Ross,483,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,40,"(chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya (miming washing hair, that's the best I could think of), yaw..."
2782,2782,Ross,484,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,42,"Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!"
2784,2784,Ross,485,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,44,"No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! (pauses) Or isn't..."
2786,2786,Ross,486,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,46,Susan...
2788,2788,Ross,487,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,48,"Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!"
2791,2791,Ross,488,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,51,"(flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!"
2794,2794,Ross,489,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,54,"Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?"
2796,2796,Ross,490,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,56,"(interrupts) No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go."
2798,2798,Ross,491,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,58,"No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach, then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)"
2801,2801,Ross,492,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,61,"(on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. (Carol and Susan laugh)"
2802,2802,Chandler,381,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,62,"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
2803,2803,Joey,290,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,63,That's the rule.
2804,2804,Chandler,382,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,64,"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
2805,2805,Joey,291,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,65,How'd you get to that?
2806,2806,Chandler,383,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,66,"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
2807,2807,Joey,292,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,67,You knew about that?
2808,2808,Chandler,384,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,68,"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
2809,2809,Joey,293,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,69,"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
2810,2810,Chandler,385,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,70,"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
2811,2811,Joey,294,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,71,Yeah
2812,2812,Chandler,386,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,72,You think we're ready for something like that?
2813,2813,Joey,295,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,73,Why not?
2814,2814,Chandler,387,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,74,"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
2815,2815,Joey,296,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,75,"Why, are you moving out?"
2816,2816,Chandler,388,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,76,I'm not moving out.
2817,2817,Joey,297,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,77,You'd tell me if you were moving out right
2818,2818,Chandler,389,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,78,"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
2819,2819,Joey,298,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,79,"Aw, I know all about Kip!"
2820,2820,Chandler,390,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,80,"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
2821,2821,Joey,299,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,81,"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
2822,2822,Chandler,391,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,82,"Aw, don't do that"
2824,2824,Phoebe,287,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,84,"Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)"
2827,2827,Phoebe,288,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,87,"Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?"
2829,2829,Phoebe,289,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,89,"Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"
2830,2830,Phoebe,290,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,90,"Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."
2832,2832,Phoebe,291,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,92,"Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!"
2833,2833,Rachel,344,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,93,"(to Ross) I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows...."
2834,2834,Monica,439,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,94,And Monica knows...
2835,2835,Ross,493,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,95,"Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
2836,2836,Monica,440,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,96,"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me."
2837,2837,Joey,300,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,97,So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and waves arms frantically in protest)
2838,2838,Ross,494,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,98,"Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!"
2839,2839,Monica,441,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,99,"I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!"
2840,2840,Joey,301,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,100,Or an uncle...
2842,2842,Ross,495,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,102,Hi Pheebs!
2843,2843,Rachel,345,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,103,Pheebs!
2844,2844,Phoebe,292,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,104,Fine!
2845,2845,Monica,442,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,105,"Phoebe, what's the matter?"
2846,2846,Phoebe,293,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,106,"Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
2848,2848,Rachel,346,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,108,"Oh, right, that's me!"
2849,2849,Joey,302,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,109,"Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on."
2850,2850,Chandler,392,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,110,Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
2851,2851,Monica,443,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,111,"Phoebe, what is it?"
2852,2852,Phoebe,294,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,112,"All right, you know Paolo?"
2853,2853,Ross,496,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,113,"I'm familiar with his work, yes..."
2854,2854,Phoebe,295,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,114,"Well, he made a move on me."
2855,2855,Joey,303,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,115,"Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"
2856,2856,Chandler,393,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,116,"More coffee over here, please!"
2858,2858,Monica,444,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,118,"Well, what happened?"
2859,2859,Phoebe,296,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,119,"Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. (A flashback starts Paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up Phoebe's legs.)"
2861,2861,Ross,497,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,121,My God.
2862,2862,Monica,445,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,122,Are you sure?
2863,2863,Phoebe,297,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,123,"Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.) And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues: Paolo rolls over, Phoebe looks down, then quickly looks up, bites lip, shakes her head)"
2864,2864,Monica,446,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,124,Was it...?
2865,2865,Phoebe,298,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,125,"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there."
2867,2867,Rachel,347,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,127,"""Ooo,"" what?"
2868,2868,Phoebe,299,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,128,Uma Thurman.
2869,2869,Monica,447,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,129,Oh!
2870,2870,Ross,498,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,130,The actress!
2871,2871,Ross,499,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,131,Thanks Rach.
2872,2872,Chandler,394,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,132,So what are you gonna do?
2873,2873,Ross,500,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,133,"You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to chime in)"
2874,2874,Chandler,395,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,134,"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
2875,2875,Joey,304,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,135,Feminist issue. That's where I went!
2876,2876,Phoebe,300,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,136,She is gonna hate me.
2877,2877,Ross,501,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,137,"(sympathetic yet...) Yeah, well..."
2878,2878,Joey,305,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,138,"Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a table)"
2879,2879,Chandler,396,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,139,That's patio furniture!
2880,2880,Joey,306,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,140,"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!"
2881,2881,Chandler,397,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,141,(gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
2882,2882,Joey,307,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,142,"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something."""
2883,2883,Chandler,398,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,143,You pick one.
2884,2884,Joey,308,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,144,"All right, how about the ladybugs?"
2885,2885,Chandler,399,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,145,"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"
2886,2886,Joey,309,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,146,"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
2887,2887,Chandler,400,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,147,"Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)"
2888,2888,Phoebe,301,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,148,Hey!
2889,2889,Rachel,348,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,149,Hi Pheebs!
2890,2890,Phoebe,302,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,150,Are you moving out?
2891,2891,Rachel,349,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,151,"No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and shows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's."
2892,2892,Phoebe,303,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,152,"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
2893,2893,Rachel,350,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,153,"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
2894,2894,Phoebe,304,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,154,"Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um,"
2895,2895,Rachel,351,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,155,"Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs..."
2896,2896,Phoebe,305,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,156,"Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)"
2897,2897,Rachel,352,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,157,"(taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie, overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!"
2898,2898,Phoebe,306,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,158,"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies"
2899,2899,Rachel,353,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,159,"All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had."
2900,2900,Phoebe,307,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,160,Which proves that I never lie.
2901,2901,Rachel,354,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,161,I guess you don't.
2902,2902,Phoebe,308,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,162,Paolo made a pass at me.
2903,2903,Chandler,401,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,163,"So, what do you think?"
2904,2904,Ross,502,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,164,I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
2905,2905,Chandler,402,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,165,I know!
2906,2906,Monica,448,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,166,"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?"
2907,2907,Joey,310,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,167,"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"
2908,2908,Monica,449,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,168,Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at Chandler) You suck!
2909,2909,Phoebe,309,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,169,Are you okay?
2910,2910,Rachel,355,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,170,I need some milk.
2911,2911,Phoebe,310,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,171,"Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup) Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?"
2912,2912,Rachel,356,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,172,"No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..."" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!"
2913,2913,Phoebe,311,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,173,"I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!"
2914,2914,Rachel,357,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,174,"Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!"
2916,2916,Phoebe,312,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,176,"No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?"
2917,2917,Rachel,358,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,177,"I don't know...right, he's the pig!"
2918,2918,Phoebe,313,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,178,Such a pig!
2919,2919,Rachel,359,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,179,"Oh, God, he's such a pig,"
2920,2920,Phoebe,314,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,180,Oh he's like a...
2921,2921,Rachel,360,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,181,He's like a big disgusting...
2922,2922,Phoebe,315,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,182,...like a...
2923,2923,Rachel,361,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,183,...pig...pig man!
2924,2924,Phoebe,316,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,184,"Yes, good! Ok..."
2925,2925,Rachel,362,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,185,"(voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?"
2926,2926,Phoebe,317,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,186,"(raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you..."
2927,2927,Rachel,363,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,187,"Ok, Ok, Pheebs..."
2928,2928,Phoebe,318,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,188,The end.
2929,2929,Rachel,364,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,189,"Oh, God..."
2930,2930,Phoebe,319,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,190,Should I not have told you?
2931,2931,Rachel,365,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,191,"No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better..."
2932,2932,Phoebe,320,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,192,"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so..."
2933,2933,Monica,450,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,193,"We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game! Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)"
2934,2934,Ross,503,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,194,"(wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts."
2935,2935,Joey,311,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,195,"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team."
2936,2936,Ross,504,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,196,"Come on, two on one."
2937,2937,Chandler,403,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,197,"What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
2938,2938,Ross,505,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,198,"What, now?"
2939,2939,Joey,312,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,199,"Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
2940,2940,Chandler,404,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,200,"My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)"
2942,2942,Ross,506,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,202,(entering) How's it going?
2943,2943,Monica,451,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,203,"Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"" or, ""Enormous breasts!"" Here he comes!"
2944,2944,Phoebe,321,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,204,Ooh!
2946,2946,Phoebe,322,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,206,"Oh, ok bye-bye."
2947,2947,Monica,452,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,207,"Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles."
2949,2949,Ross,507,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,209,"Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)"
2950,2950,Phoebe,323,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,210,"Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)"
2951,2951,Ross,508,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,211,"Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed..."
2952,2952,Monica,453,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,212,"Oh, you're right."
2953,2953,Ross,509,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,213,(pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.
2954,2954,Ross,510,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,214,Hey.
2955,2955,Rachel,366,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,215,Hey.
2956,2956,Ross,511,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,216,You all right?
2957,2957,Rachel,367,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,217,"Ooh, I've been better..."
2958,2958,Ross,512,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,218,"Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you."
2959,2959,Rachel,368,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,219,"Oh, Ross..."
2960,2960,Ross,513,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,220,What?
2961,2961,Rachel,369,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,221,"I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)"
2962,2962,Ross,514,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,222,Huh.
2963,2963,Rachel,370,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,223,"Oh Ross, you're so great!"
2964,2964,Ross,515,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,224,Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)
2965,2965,Monica,454,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,225,"Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?"
2966,2966,Rachel,371,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,226,Oh...
2967,2967,Phoebe,324,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,227,You ok?
2968,2968,Rachel,372,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,228,...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
2969,2969,Phoebe,325,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,229,Yep!
2970,2970,Ross,516,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,230,"See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process."
2971,2971,Rachel,373,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,231,"No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want"
2972,2972,Ross,517,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,232,"Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo."
2973,2973,Rachel,374,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,233,"No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one."
2974,2974,Ross,518,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,234,(astonished) What?
2975,2975,Rachel,375,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,235,What?
2976,2976,Ross,519,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,236,"I-I'm, I'm having a boy?"
2977,2977,Rachel,376,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,237,"Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy."
2978,2978,Ross,520,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,238,"Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?"
2980,2980,Ross,521,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,240,"I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!"
2981,2981,Chandler,405,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,241,Wha-
2982,2982,Joey,313,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,242,Wha-
2984,2984,Ross,522,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,244,I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
2985,2985,Joey,314,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,245,Hey!
2986,2986,Chandler,406,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,246,Hey!
2988,2988,Ross,523,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,248,I'm having a son. Um...
2990,2990,Monica,455,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,250,Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
2992,2992,Monica,456,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,252,"Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!"
2993,2993,Joey,315,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,253,"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!"
2994,2994,Chandler,407,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,254,"Yeah, get out!"
2995,2995,Monica,457,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,255,"You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone."
2996,2996,Chandler,408,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,256,(to Joey) One more game?
2997,2997,Joey,316,1,12,The Dozen Lasagnas,257,Oh yeah!
2998,2998,Rachel,377,1,13,The Boobies,0,"That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock"
2999,2999,Chandler,409,1,13,The Boobies,1,I'm sorry!
3000,3000,Rachel,378,1,13,The Boobies,2,You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
3001,3001,Chandler,410,1,13,The Boobies,3,"Rachel, wait, wait."
3002,3002,Rachel,379,1,13,The Boobies,4,"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!"
3003,3003,Chandler,411,1,13,The Boobies,5,Can I just say one thing?
3004,3004,Rachel,380,1,13,The Boobies,6,What? What?!
3005,3005,Chandler,412,1,13,The Boobies,7,That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
3006,3006,Rachel,381,1,13,The Boobies,8,Oh!!
3008,3008,Phoebe,326,1,13,The Boobies,10,"Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower."
3010,3010,Phoebe,327,1,13,The Boobies,12,Oops!
3012,3012,Phoebe,328,1,13,The Boobies,14,"Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you."
3014,3014,Phoebe,329,1,13,The Boobies,16,Isn't he great?
3015,3015,Rachel,382,1,13,The Boobies,17,He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
3016,3016,Phoebe,330,1,13,The Boobies,18,"I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?"
3017,3017,Monica,458,1,13,The Boobies,19,"So, you think you'll do it on his couch?"
3018,3018,Phoebe,331,1,13,The Boobies,20,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl."
3019,3019,Rachel,383,1,13,The Boobies,21,"Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?"
3020,3020,Chandler,413,1,13,The Boobies,22,"Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)"
3021,3021,Rachel,384,1,13,The Boobies,23,"No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?"
3022,3022,Chandler,414,1,13,The Boobies,24,Okay.
3024,3024,Chandler,415,1,13,The Boobies,26,"No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies."
3025,3025,Ross,524,1,13,The Boobies,27,You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
3026,3026,Chandler,416,1,13,The Boobies,28,It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
3027,3027,Rachel,385,1,13,The Boobies,29,"Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?"
3028,3028,Phoebe,332,1,13,The Boobies,30,"Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts."
3029,3029,Rachel,386,1,13,The Boobies,31,"Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change."
3030,3030,Chandler,417,1,13,The Boobies,32,"Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies."
3031,3031,Rachel,387,1,13,The Boobies,33,"Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice."
3032,3032,Chandler,418,1,13,The Boobies,34,"Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me."
3034,3034,Chandler,419,1,13,The Boobies,36,"Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?"
3036,3036,Chandler,420,1,13,The Boobies,38,Huh.
3038,3038,Chandler,421,1,13,The Boobies,40,"Uhhuh, how did you know that?"
3040,3040,Joey,317,1,13,The Boobies,42,"Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?"
3042,3042,Monica,459,1,13,The Boobies,44,"Hey, how long are you in the city?"
3044,3044,Phoebe,333,1,13,The Boobies,46,"Oh, this is my friend Roger."
3049,3049,Joey,318,1,13,The Boobies,51,"Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)"
3052,3052,Joey,319,1,13,The Boobies,54,"(Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?"
3054,3054,Joey,320,1,13,The Boobies,56,Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)
3056,3056,Joey,321,1,13,The Boobies,58,Since then?!
3058,3058,Joey,322,1,13,The Boobies,60,...I d'know.
3060,3060,Joey,323,1,13,The Boobies,62,You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)
3062,3062,Joey,324,1,13,The Boobies,64,Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
3064,3064,Joey,325,1,13,The Boobies,66,"It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be cool.... This blows!"
3065,3065,Rachel,388,1,13,The Boobies,67,"I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"
3066,3066,Chandler,422,1,13,The Boobies,68,(Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?
3067,3067,Rachel,389,1,13,The Boobies,69,Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
3068,3068,Ross,525,1,13,The Boobies,70,"Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."
3069,3069,Chandler,423,1,13,The Boobies,71,"Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
3070,3070,Rachel,390,1,13,The Boobies,72,"C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat."
3071,3071,Chandler,424,1,13,The Boobies,73,Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
3072,3072,Monica,460,1,13,The Boobies,74,Hello?
3073,3073,Phoebe,334,1,13,The Boobies,75,(Intercom) It's Phoebe.
3075,3075,Monica,461,1,13,The Boobies,77,C'mon up.
3076,3076,Chandler,425,1,13,The Boobies,78,"(Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here."
3077,3077,Joey,326,1,13,The Boobies,79,What's the matter with Rog?
3078,3078,Ross,526,1,13,The Boobies,80,Yeah.
3079,3079,Chandler,426,1,13,The Boobies,81,"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."
3080,3080,Ross,527,1,13,The Boobies,82,"What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad."
3081,3081,Ross,528,1,13,The Boobies,83,"Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?"
3083,3083,Ross,529,1,13,The Boobies,85,Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
3085,3085,Monica,462,1,13,The Boobies,87,"Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing."
3087,3087,Ross,530,1,13,The Boobies,89,That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
3088,3088,Monica,463,1,13,The Boobies,90,Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
3089,3089,Phoebe,335,1,13,The Boobies,91,Isn't he good?
3090,3090,Ross,531,1,13,The Boobies,92,"Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying..."
3091,3091,Monica,464,1,13,The Boobies,93,"Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!"
3092,3092,Ross,532,1,13,The Boobies,94,"Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!"
3093,3093,Rachel,391,1,13,The Boobies,95,"You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in."
3095,3095,Phoebe,336,1,13,The Boobies,97,"Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?"
3097,3097,Phoebe,337,1,13,The Boobies,99,"Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon."
3098,3098,Monica,465,1,13,The Boobies,100,You're welcome.
3100,3100,Monica,466,1,13,The Boobies,102,Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)
3101,3101,Joey,327,1,13,The Boobies,103,"Night, you guys."
3102,3102,Chandler,427,1,13,The Boobies,104,"Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
3103,3103,Joey,328,1,13,The Boobies,105,"Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?"
3105,3105,Joey,329,1,13,The Boobies,107,I'm Joey Tribbiani.
3107,3107,Chandler,428,1,13,The Boobies,109,"Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"
3110,3110,Chandler,429,1,13,The Boobies,112,"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."
3113,3113,Joey,330,1,13,The Boobies,115,"Dad, Ronni's here."
3119,3119,Chandler,430,1,13,The Boobies,121,"So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?"
3123,3123,Joey,331,1,13,The Boobies,125,Who-ah-ho.
3126,3126,Joey,332,1,13,The Boobies,128,No you won't.
3128,3128,Joey,333,1,13,The Boobies,130,If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
3130,3130,Joey,334,1,13,The Boobies,132,"That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend."
3132,3132,Joey,335,1,13,The Boobies,134,"Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."
3134,3134,Chandler,431,1,13,The Boobies,136,"C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by ""No thanks, it's late."""
3135,3135,Joey,336,1,13,The Boobies,137,"Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough."
3137,3137,Joey,337,1,13,The Boobies,139,"Well, either you break it off with Ronni"
3139,3139,Joey,338,1,13,The Boobies,141,Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
3141,3141,Joey,339,1,13,The Boobies,143,I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
3142,3142,Chandler,432,1,13,The Boobies,144,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
3143,3143,Joey,340,1,13,The Boobies,145,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
3144,3144,Chandler,433,1,13,The Boobies,146,"Well, you're gonna."
3145,3145,Joey,341,1,13,The Boobies,147,"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
3146,3146,Chandler,434,1,13,The Boobies,148,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
3147,3147,Joey,342,1,13,The Boobies,149,"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
3148,3148,Chandler,435,1,13,The Boobies,150,"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
3149,3149,Joey,343,1,13,The Boobies,151,No.
3150,3150,Chandler,436,1,13,The Boobies,152,"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
3151,3151,Joey,344,1,13,The Boobies,153,You really think so?
3152,3152,Chandler,437,1,13,The Boobies,154,Yeah. I really do.
3153,3153,Joey,345,1,13,The Boobies,155,"Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)"
3154,3154,Chandler,438,1,13,The Boobies,156,Get off!
3156,3156,Monica,467,1,13,The Boobies,158,Hi...May I help you?
3158,3158,Monica,468,1,13,The Boobies,160,Okay...who are you?
3160,3160,Monica,469,1,13,The Boobies,162,"Oh, c'mon in."
3162,3162,Rachel,392,1,13,The Boobies,164,"Hi, I'm Rachel."
3164,3164,Rachel,393,1,13,The Boobies,166,Bathroom's up there.
3166,3166,Rachel,394,1,13,The Boobies,168,"Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?"
3168,3168,Rachel,395,1,13,The Boobies,170,"Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib."
3170,3170,Rachel,396,1,13,The Boobies,172,Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
3171,3171,Joey,346,1,13,The Boobies,173,(Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!
3172,3172,Rachel,397,1,13,The Boobies,174,I thought it was Chandler!
3173,3173,Chandler,439,1,13,The Boobies,175,(Comes out of his room) What? What?
3174,3174,Rachel,398,1,13,The Boobies,176,You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
3175,3175,Chandler,440,1,13,The Boobies,177,"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me."
3177,3177,Phoebe,338,1,13,The Boobies,179,Hey.
3178,3178,Monica,470,1,13,The Boobies,180,How's it going?
3179,3179,Phoebe,339,1,13,The Boobies,181,Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
3180,3180,Phoebe,340,1,13,The Boobies,182,So what's going on?
3181,3181,Monica,471,1,13,The Boobies,183,"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger."
3182,3182,Ross,533,1,13,The Boobies,184,"I dunno, there's just something about..."
3183,3183,Chandler,441,1,13,The Boobies,185,Basically we just feel that he's...
3184,3184,Rachel,399,1,13,The Boobies,186,We hate that guy.
3186,3186,Ross,534,1,13,The Boobies,188,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
3187,3187,Phoebe,341,1,13,The Boobies,189,"Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
3189,3189,Rachel,400,1,13,The Boobies,191,We're sorry.
3190,3190,Joey,347,1,13,The Boobies,192,Ma! What're you doing here?
3192,3192,Joey,348,1,13,The Boobies,194,Oww! Big ring!
3194,3194,Joey,349,1,13,The Boobies,196,"Hold on, you-you knew?"
3196,3196,Joey,350,1,13,The Boobies,198,"So then how could you I mean, how could you?!"
3198,3198,Joey,351,1,13,The Boobies,200,"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?"
3200,3200,Joey,352,1,13,The Boobies,202,I'm...happy...for you?
3202,3202,Joey,353,1,13,The Boobies,204,"Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."
3204,3204,Joey,354,1,13,The Boobies,206,Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
3206,3206,Joey,355,1,13,The Boobies,208,With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.
3208,3208,Phoebe,342,1,13,The Boobies,210,"Nothing, nothing."
3210,3210,Phoebe,343,1,13,The Boobies,212,"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't."
3212,3212,Phoebe,344,1,13,The Boobies,214,But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
3214,3214,Phoebe,345,1,13,The Boobies,216,Intense and creepy.
3216,3216,Phoebe,346,1,13,The Boobies,218,"But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
3218,3218,Phoebe,347,1,13,The Boobies,220,"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!"
3220,3220,Monica,472,1,13,The Boobies,222,"So you talked to your dad, huh."
3221,3221,Joey,356,1,13,The Boobies,223,"Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today."
3222,3222,Rachel,401,1,13,The Boobies,224,Wow.
3223,3223,Chandler,442,1,13,The Boobies,225,Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
3224,3224,Ross,535,1,13,The Boobies,226,"So Joey, you okay?"
3225,3225,Joey,357,1,13,The Boobies,227,"Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
3226,3226,Rachel,402,1,13,The Boobies,228,"Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them."
3227,3227,Chandler,443,1,13,The Boobies,229,"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
3228,3228,Phoebe,348,1,13,The Boobies,230,(entering) Hey.
3230,3230,Monica,473,1,13,The Boobies,232,How's it going?
3231,3231,Phoebe,349,1,13,The Boobies,233,"Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger."
3233,3233,Phoebe,350,1,13,The Boobies,235,"Yeah, right."
3235,3235,Rachel,403,1,13,The Boobies,237,What happened?
3236,3236,Phoebe,351,1,13,The Boobies,238,"I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!"
3238,3238,Phoebe,352,1,13,The Boobies,240,"Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
3239,3239,Joey,358,1,13,The Boobies,241,"Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica in a towel)"
3240,3240,Monica,474,1,13,The Boobies,242,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
3241,3241,Joey,359,1,13,The Boobies,243,Sorry. Wrong boobies.
3242,3242,Monica,475,1,13,The Boobies,244,"Hello, Joey."
3244,3244,Joey,360,1,14,The Candy Hearts,0,"I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
3245,3245,Ross,536,1,14,The Candy Hearts,1,She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
3246,3246,Chandler,444,1,14,The Candy Hearts,2,Any contact?
3247,3247,Ross,537,1,14,The Candy Hearts,3,She lent me an egg once.
3248,3248,Joey,361,1,14,The Candy Hearts,4,You're in!
3249,3249,Ross,538,1,14,The Candy Hearts,5,"Aw, right."
3251,3251,Ross,539,1,14,The Candy Hearts,7,Hey. (stutters something incoherent)
3252,3252,Chandler,445,1,14,The Candy Hearts,8,"Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third..."
3253,3253,Joey,362,1,14,The Candy Hearts,9,"Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks."
3254,3254,Ross,540,1,14,The Candy Hearts,10,An egg?
3255,3255,Joey,363,1,14,The Candy Hearts,11,"Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."""
3256,3256,Chandler,446,1,14,The Candy Hearts,12,I think it's winning.
3257,3257,Ross,541,1,14,The Candy Hearts,13,I think it's insane.
3258,3258,Chandler,447,1,14,The Candy Hearts,14,"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
3259,3259,Joey,364,1,14,The Candy Hearts,15,Think it'll work?
3260,3260,Chandler,448,1,14,The Candy Hearts,16,"No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg."
3261,3261,Monica,476,1,14,The Candy Hearts,17,You can not do this.
3262,3262,Rachel,404,1,14,The Candy Hearts,18,"Do what, do what?"
3263,3263,Monica,477,1,14,The Candy Hearts,19,Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
3264,3264,Rachel,405,1,14,The Candy Hearts,20,No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
3265,3265,Phoebe,353,1,14,The Candy Hearts,21,"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
3266,3266,Monica,478,1,14,The Candy Hearts,22,"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do."
3267,3267,Rachel,406,1,14,The Candy Hearts,23,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
3268,3268,Joey,365,1,14,The Candy Hearts,24,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
3269,3269,Chandler,449,1,14,The Candy Hearts,25,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
3270,3270,Joey,366,1,14,The Candy Hearts,26,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
3271,3271,Chandler,450,1,14,The Candy Hearts,27,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
3272,3272,Joey,367,1,14,The Candy Hearts,28,"Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this."
3273,3273,Ross,542,1,14,The Candy Hearts,29,Hi. She said yes.
3274,3274,Chandler,451,1,14,The Candy Hearts,30,"Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?"
3275,3275,Joey,368,1,14,The Candy Hearts,31,(Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?
3276,3276,Chandler,452,1,14,The Candy Hearts,32,"Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
3278,3278,Chandler,453,1,14,The Candy Hearts,34,...And what did you bring?
3280,3280,Chandler,454,1,14,The Candy Hearts,36,Janice?
3282,3282,Chandler,455,1,14,The Candy Hearts,38,"(angrily) Hey, it's Janice."
3283,3283,Chandler,456,1,14,The Candy Hearts,39,"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window."
3284,3284,Joey,369,1,14,The Candy Hearts,40,"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down."
3285,3285,Chandler,457,1,14,The Candy Hearts,41,Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
3286,3286,Joey,370,1,14,The Candy Hearts,42,"(at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous."
3287,3287,Chandler,458,1,14,The Candy Hearts,43,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
3288,3288,Rachel,407,1,14,The Candy Hearts,44,"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
3289,3289,Monica,479,1,14,The Candy Hearts,45,Which one was Pete Carney?
3290,3290,Rachel,408,1,14,The Candy Hearts,46,"Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. (imitating) ""Was it good for you?"""
3291,3291,Monica,480,1,14,The Candy Hearts,47,"Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. (imitating) ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once."
3292,3292,Rachel,409,1,14,The Candy Hearts,48,How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
3293,3293,Monica,481,1,14,The Candy Hearts,49,I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
3294,3294,Phoebe,354,1,14,The Candy Hearts,50,I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
3295,3295,Monica,482,1,14,The Candy Hearts,51,"There's more beer, right?"
3296,3296,Phoebe,355,1,14,The Candy Hearts,52,"Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
3297,3297,Rachel,410,1,14,The Candy Hearts,53,"Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
3298,3298,Phoebe,356,1,14,The Candy Hearts,54,"Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect."
3299,3299,Monica,483,1,14,The Candy Hearts,55,"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
3300,3300,Phoebe,357,1,14,The Candy Hearts,56,"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
3301,3301,Rachel,411,1,14,The Candy Hearts,57,Or?
3302,3302,Phoebe,358,1,14,The Candy Hearts,58,"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
3303,3303,Monica,484,1,14,The Candy Hearts,59,Burning's good.
3304,3304,Rachel,412,1,14,The Candy Hearts,60,"Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
3306,3306,Joey,371,1,14,The Candy Hearts,62,"Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?"
3308,3308,Chandler,459,1,14,The Candy Hearts,64,That's OK.
3310,3310,Joey,372,1,14,The Candy Hearts,66,(to Lorraine) We can't do that.
3311,3311,Chandler,460,1,14,The Candy Hearts,67,(disgusted) What? What can't you do?
3312,3312,Joey,373,1,14,The Candy Hearts,68,"Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?"
3313,3313,Joey,374,1,14,The Candy Hearts,69,"Uh, we might be leaving now."
3314,3314,Chandler,461,1,14,The Candy Hearts,70,"Tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
3315,3315,Joey,375,1,14,The Candy Hearts,71,"She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
3316,3316,Chandler,462,1,14,The Candy Hearts,72,"Ok, you can not do this to me."
3317,3317,Joey,376,1,14,The Candy Hearts,73,"You're right, I'm sorry. You're right."
3319,3319,Joey,377,1,14,The Candy Hearts,75,"I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler."
3320,3320,Chandler,463,1,14,The Candy Hearts,76,I hope she throws up on you.
3321,3321,Chandler,464,1,14,The Candy Hearts,77,So...
3323,3323,Chandler,465,1,14,The Candy Hearts,79,"Oh, what a crappy night!"
3325,3325,Chandler,466,1,14,The Candy Hearts,81,"Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?"
3327,3327,Chandler,467,1,14,The Candy Hearts,83,Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
3329,3329,Chandler,468,1,14,The Candy Hearts,85,"You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?"
3331,3331,Chandler,469,1,14,The Candy Hearts,87,"That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know..."
3334,3334,Chandler,470,1,14,The Candy Hearts,90,"No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice."
3336,3336,Monica,485,1,14,The Candy Hearts,92,"Oh, Chandler, sorry."
3337,3337,Monica,486,1,14,The Candy Hearts,93,"Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice."
3339,3339,Chandler,471,1,14,The Candy Hearts,95,"Ok, well, this was very special."
3340,3340,Monica,487,1,14,The Candy Hearts,96,"Rach, come see who's out here!"
3341,3341,Rachel,413,1,14,The Candy Hearts,97,"Oh my god. Janice, hi!"
3342,3342,Chandler,472,1,14,The Candy Hearts,98,Janice is gonna go away now.
3343,3343,Monica,488,1,14,The Candy Hearts,99,I'll be right back.
3344,3344,Rachel,414,1,14,The Candy Hearts,100,"Oh, Joey, look who it is."
3345,3345,Joey,378,1,14,The Candy Hearts,101,(in disbelief) Whoa.
3346,3346,Chandler,473,1,14,The Candy Hearts,102,"Oh, good, Joey's home now."
3348,3348,Monica,489,1,14,The Candy Hearts,104,"Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to Chandler) He just happened to call."
3350,3350,Ross,543,1,14,The Candy Hearts,106,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
3352,3352,Ross,544,1,14,The Candy Hearts,108,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend."
3354,3354,Ross,545,1,14,The Candy Hearts,110,If you wanna put a label on it.
3356,3356,Ross,546,1,14,The Candy Hearts,112,"Nope, nope, that's it."
3357,3357,Ross,547,1,14,The Candy Hearts,113,"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol and Susan) Helloo!"
3358,3358,Phoebe,359,1,14,The Candy Hearts,114,"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
3359,3359,Monica,490,1,14,The Candy Hearts,115,"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca."
3360,3360,Phoebe,360,1,14,The Candy Hearts,116,"Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man."
3361,3361,Rachel,415,1,14,The Candy Hearts,117,"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."
3362,3362,Monica,491,1,14,The Candy Hearts,118,Can we just start throwing things in?
3363,3363,Phoebe,361,1,14,The Candy Hearts,119,"Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK."
3364,3364,Rachel,416,1,14,The Candy Hearts,120,"(tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts."
3365,3365,Phoebe,362,1,14,The Candy Hearts,121,"Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah."
3366,3366,Monica,492,1,14,The Candy Hearts,122,"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
3367,3367,Rachel,417,1,14,The Candy Hearts,123,(looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater.
3368,3368,Monica,493,1,14,The Candy Hearts,124,No.
3370,3370,Rachel,418,1,14,The Candy Hearts,126,And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
3371,3371,Monica,494,1,14,The Candy Hearts,127,"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure..."
3372,3372,Chandler,474,1,14,The Candy Hearts,128,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
3373,3373,Joey,379,1,14,The Candy Hearts,129,I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
3374,3374,Chandler,475,1,14,The Candy Hearts,130,"Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
3376,3376,Chandler,476,1,14,The Candy Hearts,132,"Hi, Just Janice."
3378,3378,Joey,380,1,14,The Candy Hearts,134,"(to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will."
3379,3379,Ross,548,1,14,The Candy Hearts,135,"So, um, what do you do for a living?"
3383,3383,Ross,549,1,14,The Candy Hearts,139,"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
3385,3385,Ross,550,1,14,The Candy Hearts,141,Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
3387,3387,Ross,551,1,14,The Candy Hearts,143,"Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
3390,3390,Monica,495,1,14,The Candy Hearts,146,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
3393,3393,Rachel,419,1,14,The Candy Hearts,149,Really?
3396,3396,Chandler,477,1,14,The Candy Hearts,152,"Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever."
3398,3398,Chandler,478,1,14,The Candy Hearts,154,"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out."
3400,3400,Chandler,479,1,14,The Candy Hearts,156,(surprised) It is?
3402,3402,Chandler,480,1,14,The Candy Hearts,158,"Oh no, you see, actually it is."
3404,3404,Chandler,481,1,14,The Candy Hearts,160,"Oh, no I don't."
3406,3406,Chandler,482,1,14,The Candy Hearts,162,"I did, but..."
3408,3408,Chandler,483,1,14,The Candy Hearts,164,Call me!
3410,3410,Ross,552,1,14,The Candy Hearts,166,"You did so. I swear, I swear(noticing Kristin's absence) How long has she been in the bathroom?"
3412,3412,Ross,553,1,14,The Candy Hearts,168,Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
3414,3414,Ross,554,1,14,The Candy Hearts,170,"Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.)"
3416,3416,Ross,555,1,14,The Candy Hearts,172,"No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you."
3418,3418,Ross,556,1,14,The Candy Hearts,174,"No but, no but."
3420,3420,Ross,557,1,14,The Candy Hearts,176,"That's easy for you to say, you found one already."
3424,3424,Rachel,420,1,14,The Candy Hearts,180,"So, um, will you bring the truck?"
3426,3426,Rachel,421,1,14,The Candy Hearts,182,"Oh, my god."
3427,3427,Phoebe,363,1,14,The Candy Hearts,183,"See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
3428,3428,Monica,496,1,14,The Candy Hearts,184,They're nice guys.
3429,3429,Rachel,422,1,14,The Candy Hearts,185,"Oh, they're firemen guys."
3433,3433,Rachel,423,1,15,The Stoned Guy,0,(to Joey) Coffee. (Hands it to him.)
3434,3434,Joey,381,1,15,The Stoned Guy,1,Thank you.
3435,3435,Rachel,424,1,15,The Stoned Guy,2,(to Ross) Cappuccino. (Hands it to him.)
3436,3436,Ross,558,1,15,The Stoned Guy,3,Grazie.
3437,3437,Rachel,425,1,15,The Stoned Guy,4,And a nice hot cider for Monica. (Hands it to her.)
3438,3438,Monica,497,1,15,The Stoned Guy,5,"Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?"
3439,3439,Rachel,426,1,15,The Stoned Guy,6,Yeah?
3440,3440,Monica,498,1,15,The Stoned Guy,7,Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
3441,3441,Rachel,427,1,15,The Stoned Guy,8,"Oh! That's why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon stick.) I'm sorry!"
3443,3443,Chandler,484,1,15,The Stoned Guy,10,"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you."
3445,3445,Chandler,485,1,15,The Stoned Guy,12,"Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing."
3446,3446,Phoebe,364,1,15,The Stoned Guy,13,"Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..."
3447,3447,Chandler,486,1,15,The Stoned Guy,14,Hey!
3449,3449,Phoebe,365,1,15,The Stoned Guy,16,Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
3450,3450,Ross,559,1,15,The Stoned Guy,17,What's going on?
3452,3452,Chandler,487,1,15,The Stoned Guy,19,"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
3454,3454,Chandler,488,1,15,The Stoned Guy,21,So.... I quit.
3456,3456,Chandler,489,1,15,The Stoned Guy,23,Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
3457,3457,Monica,499,1,15,The Stoned Guy,24,"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years."
3458,3458,Chandler,490,1,15,The Stoned Guy,25,"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do."
3459,3459,Phoebe,366,1,15,The Stoned Guy,26,So was it a lot more money?
3460,3460,Chandler,491,1,15,The Stoned Guy,27,It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
3461,3461,Rachel,428,1,15,The Stoned Guy,28,... the WENUS?
3462,3462,Chandler,492,1,15,The Stoned Guy,29,Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
3463,3463,Rachel,429,1,15,The Stoned Guy,30,(sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.
3464,3464,Joey,382,1,15,The Stoned Guy,31,So what're you going to do?
3465,3465,Chandler,493,1,15,The Stoned Guy,32,I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
3466,3466,Phoebe,367,1,15,The Stoned Guy,33,"Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef."
3467,3467,Monica,500,1,15,The Stoned Guy,34,(taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.
3468,3468,Phoebe,368,1,15,The Stoned Guy,35,"Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so...."
3469,3469,Chandler,494,1,15,The Stoned Guy,36,Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
3470,3470,Phoebe,369,1,15,The Stoned Guy,37,"(to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!"
3471,3471,Monica,501,1,15,The Stoned Guy,38,"Well, what kind of food is he looking for?"
3472,3472,Phoebe,370,1,15,The Stoned Guy,39,"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu."
3473,3473,Monica,502,1,15,The Stoned Guy,40,(excited) Oh my God!
3474,3474,Phoebe,371,1,15,The Stoned Guy,41,"Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?"
3475,3475,Chandler,495,1,15,The Stoned Guy,42,"Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
3476,3476,Phoebe,372,1,15,The Stoned Guy,43,OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!
3477,3477,Chandler,496,1,15,The Stoned Guy,44,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
3478,3478,Rachel,430,1,15,The Stoned Guy,45,"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
3479,3479,Phoebe,373,1,15,The Stoned Guy,46,"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
3480,3480,Chandler,497,1,15,The Stoned Guy,47,"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the ""a-gogo."""
3481,3481,Rachel,431,1,15,The Stoned Guy,48,Career counselor?
3482,3482,Chandler,498,1,15,The Stoned Guy,49,"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do."
3483,3483,Rachel,432,1,15,The Stoned Guy,50,I don't!
3484,3484,Chandler,499,1,15,The Stoned Guy,51,"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream."
3485,3485,Ross,560,1,15,The Stoned Guy,52,"Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech."
3486,3486,Monica,503,1,15,The Stoned Guy,53,"Oh, I love my life, I love my life!"
3487,3487,Phoebe,374,1,15,The Stoned Guy,54,Ooh! Brian's Song!
3488,3488,Rachel,433,1,15,The Stoned Guy,55,The meeting with the guy went great?
3489,3489,Monica,504,1,15,The Stoned Guy,56,"So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right."
3490,3490,Chandler,500,1,15,The Stoned Guy,57,Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
3491,3491,Monica,505,1,15,The Stoned Guy,58,"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
3492,3492,Rachel,434,1,15,The Stoned Guy,59,What are you going to make?
3493,3493,Phoebe,375,1,15,The Stoned Guy,60,(as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises.
3494,3494,Rachel,435,1,15,The Stoned Guy,61,"(pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?"
3495,3495,Monica,506,1,15,The Stoned Guy,62,I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
3496,3496,Phoebe,376,1,15,The Stoned Guy,63,"Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. (sits down)"
3497,3497,Ross,561,1,15,The Stoned Guy,64,"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?"
3498,3498,Joey,383,1,15,The Stoned Guy,65,"How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
3499,3499,Ross,562,1,15,The Stoned Guy,66,"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
3500,3500,Chandler,501,1,15,The Stoned Guy,67,Who are you going out with?
3501,3501,Phoebe,377,1,15,The Stoned Guy,68,"Oh, is this the bug lady?"
3502,3502,Rachel,436,1,15,The Stoned Guy,69,"(trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross."
3503,3503,Ross,563,1,15,The Stoned Guy,70,Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
3504,3504,Rachel,437,1,15,The Stoned Guy,71,So what are you guys going to do?
3505,3505,Ross,564,1,15,The Stoned Guy,72,"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."
3506,3506,Chandler,502,1,15,The Stoned Guy,73,And he's not speaking metaphorically.
3507,3507,Joey,384,1,15,The Stoned Guy,74,"(aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?"
3508,3508,Ross,565,1,15,The Stoned Guy,75,"Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures) huh-huh."
3509,3509,Joey,385,1,15,The Stoned Guy,76,"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
3510,3510,Ross,566,1,15,The Stoned Guy,77,"Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel..."
3512,3512,Ross,567,1,15,The Stoned Guy,79,Alright... (lifts Marcel away)
3513,3513,Monica,507,1,15,The Stoned Guy,80,"(to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse."
3514,3514,Joey,386,1,15,The Stoned Guy,81,(tasting) Mmmm. Good.
3515,3515,Monica,508,1,15,The Stoned Guy,82,Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
3516,3516,Joey,387,1,15,The Stoned Guy,83,It's creamier.
3517,3517,Monica,509,1,15,The Stoned Guy,84,"Yeah, well, is that better?"
3518,3518,Joey,388,1,15,The Stoned Guy,85,"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?"
3519,3519,Rachel,438,1,15,The Stoned Guy,86,My God! What happened to you?
3520,3520,Chandler,503,1,15,The Stoned Guy,87,"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""
3521,3521,Phoebe,378,1,15,The Stoned Guy,88,That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
3522,3522,Chandler,504,1,15,The Stoned Guy,89,"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something."
3523,3523,Rachel,439,1,15,The Stoned Guy,90,"(comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!"
3524,3524,Monica,510,1,15,The Stoned Guy,91,"(brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up."
3525,3525,Chandler,505,1,15,The Stoned Guy,92,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
3526,3526,Monica,511,1,15,The Stoned Guy,93,It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
3527,3527,Chandler,506,1,15,The Stoned Guy,94,(tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
3528,3528,Monica,512,1,15,The Stoned Guy,95,"(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock. (Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)"
3529,3529,Phoebe,379,1,15,The Stoned Guy,96,Ten dollars an hour for what?
3530,3530,Monica,513,1,15,The Stoned Guy,97,"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
3531,3531,Rachel,440,1,15,The Stoned Guy,98,(hurt) Waitressing?
3532,3532,Joey,389,1,15,The Stoned Guy,99,Uh-oh.
3533,3533,Monica,514,1,15,The Stoned Guy,100,Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
3534,3534,Rachel,441,1,15,The Stoned Guy,101,"But, but?"
3535,3535,Monica,515,1,15,The Stoned Guy,102,"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
3536,3536,Rachel,442,1,15,The Stoned Guy,103,Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
3537,3537,Chandler,507,1,15,The Stoned Guy,104,"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)"
3539,3539,Ross,568,1,15,The Stoned Guy,106,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
3541,3541,Ross,569,1,15,The Stoned Guy,108,"(embarrassed) Wha... what, here?"
3543,3543,Ross,570,1,15,The Stoned Guy,110,Ah....
3545,3545,Ross,571,1,15,The Stoned Guy,112,(panicked) Er.... um.....
3547,3547,Ross,572,1,15,The Stoned Guy,114,Um... uh.... vulva.
3548,3548,Joey,390,1,15,The Stoned Guy,115,(in disbelief) Vulva?
3549,3549,Ross,573,1,15,The Stoned Guy,116,"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling."
3550,3550,Joey,391,1,15,The Stoned Guy,117,(sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
3551,3551,Ross,574,1,15,The Stoned Guy,118,"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?"
3552,3552,Joey,392,1,15,The Stoned Guy,119,What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
3553,3553,Ross,575,1,15,The Stoned Guy,120,(deadpan) Please be kidding.
3554,3554,Joey,393,1,15,The Stoned Guy,121,"Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now."
3555,3555,Ross,576,1,15,The Stoned Guy,122,OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment...
3556,3556,Joey,394,1,15,The Stoned Guy,123,....yeah... what else?
3557,3557,Ross,577,1,15,The Stoned Guy,124,"That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. (gets up, walks across room)"
3558,3558,Joey,395,1,15,The Stoned Guy,125,"(walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
3559,3559,Ross,578,1,15,The Stoned Guy,126,"Joey, please."
3560,3560,Joey,396,1,15,The Stoned Guy,127,"Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now."
3561,3561,Ross,579,1,15,The Stoned Guy,128,(impressed) Wow.
3562,3562,Joey,397,1,15,The Stoned Guy,129,"Alright, now you say something."
3563,3563,Ross,580,1,15,The Stoned Guy,130,I... ahem... I really don't think so.
3564,3564,Joey,398,1,15,The Stoned Guy,131,"Come on! You like this woman, right?"
3565,3565,Ross,581,1,15,The Stoned Guy,132,Yeah.
3566,3566,Joey,399,1,15,The Stoned Guy,133,"You want to see her again, right?"
3567,3567,Ross,582,1,15,The Stoned Guy,134,Sure.
3568,3568,Joey,400,1,15,The Stoned Guy,135,"Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!"
3569,3569,Ross,583,1,15,The Stoned Guy,136,"OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this."
3570,3570,Joey,401,1,15,The Stoned Guy,137,"(turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead."
3571,3571,Ross,584,1,15,The Stoned Guy,138,"Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips."
3572,3572,Joey,402,1,15,The Stoned Guy,139,There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
3573,3573,Ross,585,1,15,The Stoned Guy,140,"I, er..."
3574,3574,Ross,586,1,15,The Stoned Guy,141,I want to take my tongue... and...
3575,3575,Ross,587,1,15,The Stoned Guy,142,....and....
3576,3576,Joey,403,1,15,The Stoned Guy,143,Say it... say it!
3577,3577,Ross,588,1,15,The Stoned Guy,144,...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
3578,3578,Chandler,508,1,15,The Stoned Guy,145,(smiling)....with??
3579,3579,Ross,589,1,15,The Stoned Guy,146,(rushing to explain) Funny story!
3580,3580,Joey,404,1,15,The Stoned Guy,147,You're not going to believe this!
3581,3581,Chandler,509,1,15,The Stoned Guy,148,It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
3582,3582,Joey,405,1,15,The Stoned Guy,149,"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again."
3583,3583,Chandler,510,1,15,The Stoned Guy,150,Again?
3584,3584,Joey,406,1,15,The Stoned Guy,151,"And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again."
3585,3585,Chandler,511,1,15,The Stoned Guy,152,"(on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)"
3586,3586,Chandler,512,1,15,The Stoned Guy,153,Well?
3587,3587,Phoebe,380,1,15,The Stoned Guy,154,"(excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube."
3588,3588,Chandler,513,1,15,The Stoned Guy,155,Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
3589,3589,Phoebe,381,1,15,The Stoned Guy,156,Oh! You have a window!
3590,3590,Chandler,514,1,15,The Stoned Guy,157,Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
3591,3591,Phoebe,382,1,15,The Stoned Guy,158,Oh look! That guy's peeing!
3592,3592,Chandler,515,1,15,The Stoned Guy,159,"(walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
3593,3593,Phoebe,383,1,15,The Stoned Guy,160,(sitting) OK.
3594,3594,Chandler,516,1,15,The Stoned Guy,161,"This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you come in here for a moment?"
3595,3595,Chandler,517,1,15,The Stoned Guy,162,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
3596,3596,Chandler,518,1,15,The Stoned Guy,163,"Last time I do that, I promise."
3597,3597,Monica,516,1,15,The Stoned Guy,164,"(shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)"
3598,3598,Rachel,443,1,15,The Stoned Guy,165,Who was that?
3599,3599,Monica,517,1,15,The Stoned Guy,166,Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
3600,3600,Rachel,444,1,15,The Stoned Guy,167,Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)
3601,3601,Monica,518,1,15,The Stoned Guy,168,Ten dollars an hour.
3602,3602,Rachel,445,1,15,The Stoned Guy,169,No.
3603,3603,Monica,519,1,15,The Stoned Guy,170,Twelve dollars an hour.
3604,3604,Rachel,446,1,15,The Stoned Guy,171,"Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
3605,3605,Monica,520,1,15,The Stoned Guy,172,"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it, desperate) twenty dollars an hour."
3606,3606,Rachel,447,1,15,The Stoned Guy,173,Done.
3607,3607,Rachel,448,1,15,The Stoned Guy,174,Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
3608,3608,Monica,521,1,15,The Stoned Guy,175,Hi Steve!
3610,3610,Monica,522,1,15,The Stoned Guy,177,(to Steve) This is Rachel.
3612,3612,Phoebe,384,1,15,The Stoned Guy,179,"(overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop) of, OK, smells."
3614,3614,Monica,523,1,15,The Stoned Guy,181,"Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?"
3616,3616,Rachel,449,1,15,The Stoned Guy,183,What's up?
3617,3617,Phoebe,385,1,15,The Stoned Guy,184,"(whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie."
3618,3618,Rachel,450,1,15,The Stoned Guy,185,What?
3619,3619,Phoebe,386,1,15,The Stoned Guy,186,"Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?"
3620,3620,Rachel,451,1,15,The Stoned Guy,187,"OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK."
3622,3622,Rachel,452,1,15,The Stoned Guy,189,"Let me, let me get you some wine!"
3623,3623,Monica,524,1,15,The Stoned Guy,190,"Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... (Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he finishes)... ginger."
3625,3625,Monica,525,1,15,The Stoned Guy,192,I'm so glad you liked them!
3627,3627,Monica,526,1,15,The Stoned Guy,194,"Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets."
3629,3629,Rachel,453,1,15,The Stoned Guy,196,Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
3632,3632,Monica,527,1,15,The Stoned Guy,199,(joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
3634,3634,Monica,528,1,15,The Stoned Guy,201,"You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes..."
3636,3636,Monica,529,1,15,The Stoned Guy,203,"No, we don't. (reaches for box)"
3638,3638,Monica,530,1,15,The Stoned Guy,205,"Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears."
3640,3640,Monica,531,1,15,The Stoned Guy,207,Give them to me.
3642,3642,Monica,532,1,15,The Stoned Guy,209,"No, give me the..."
3644,3644,Monica,533,1,15,The Stoned Guy,211,(furious) That's it! Dinner is over!
3646,3646,Monica,534,1,15,The Stoned Guy,213,What?
3648,3648,Monica,535,1,15,The Stoned Guy,215,"Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?"
3650,3650,Joey,407,1,15,The Stoned Guy,217,What a tool!
3651,3651,Rachel,454,1,15,The Stoned Guy,218,You don't want to work for a guy like that.
3652,3652,Ross,590,1,15,The Stoned Guy,219,Yeah!
3653,3653,Monica,536,1,15,The Stoned Guy,220,"I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it."
3654,3654,Ross,591,1,15,The Stoned Guy,221,"Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef."
3655,3655,Phoebe,387,1,15,The Stoned Guy,222,Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
3656,3656,Joey,408,1,15,The Stoned Guy,223,"(to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
3657,3657,Ross,592,1,15,The Stoned Guy,224,"Oh, I was unbelievable."
3658,3658,Joey,409,1,15,The Stoned Guy,225,"All right, Ross!"
3659,3659,Ross,593,1,15,The Stoned Guy,226,"I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers."
3660,3660,Joey,410,1,15,The Stoned Guy,227,Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?
3661,3661,Ross,594,1,15,The Stoned Guy,228,"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
3662,3662,Joey,411,1,15,The Stoned Guy,229,You cuddled.
3663,3663,Ross,595,1,15,The Stoned Guy,230,"Yeah, which was nice."
3664,3664,Phoebe,388,1,15,The Stoned Guy,231,You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
3665,3665,Rachel,455,1,15,The Stoned Guy,232,"Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?"
3666,3666,Joey,412,1,15,The Stoned Guy,233,"Yeah, where the hell is he?"
3667,3667,Chandler,519,1,15,The Stoned Guy,234,"(on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa...."
3668,3668,Phoebe,389,1,15,The Stoned Guy,235,How's this? (presses down hard)
3670,3670,Phoebe,390,1,15,The Stoned Guy,237,Sorry. How about over here? (presses down hard again)
3672,3672,Phoebe,391,1,15,The Stoned Guy,239,"See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses down elsewhere)"
3674,3674,Phoebe,392,1,15,The Stoned Guy,241,"What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in pain)"
3676,3676,Phoebe,393,1,15,The Stoned Guy,243,There you go! (She continues to work him over with her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)

3963,3963,Monica,541,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",12,(No longer touched) you don't have insurance?

3975,3975,Monica,547,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",24,"(to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set of (tiny laugh) these forms (tiny laugh)."
3977,3977,Monica,548,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",26,"(Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh) I put mine."

3980,3980,Ross,596,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",29,I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
3982,3982,Ross,597,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",31,"No, no, with him. (He mimes holding the baby like a football.) I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me."
3983,3983,Joey,413,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",32,Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
3984,3984,Ross,598,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",33,"Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field."
3985,3985,Chandler,571,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",34,What are you crazy? That's a baby!
3986,3986,Joey,414,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",35,He should take the sack?
3987,3987,Ross,599,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",36,"Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father."

3989,3989,Joey,415,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",38,"Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking."
3990,3990,Joey,416,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",39,"Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?"
3991,3991,Chandler,573,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",40,"Well, only if you order stuff."
3992,3992,Joey,417,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",41,I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
3993,3993,Ross,600,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",42,Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
3994,3994,Joey,418,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",43,When's that?
3995,3995,Ross,601,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",44,Tonight.
3996,3996,Joey,419,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",45,"Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?"
3997,3997,Ross,602,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",46,You take your time.
3998,3998,Chandler,574,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",47,There it is! So what're you gonna do?
3999,3999,Joey,420,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",48,"What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula."
4000,4000,Chandler,575,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",49,And your friend Phoebe?
4001,4001,Joey,421,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",50,"Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?"
4002,4002,Chandler,576,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",51,"Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit."
4005,4005,Monica,550,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",54,"Yes? (jumping as Rachel punches her arm) ..yes, she is."
4010,4010,Rachel,489,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",59,Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
4012,4012,Rachel,490,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",61,"I meant er, (struggling to concentrate) young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach."
4015,4015,Rachel,491,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",64,"..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it."
4016,4016,Monica,551,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",65,"Uh, you left out the stupid part."
4017,4017,Rachel,492,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",66,"Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said ""yes."""
4018,4018,Monica,552,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",67,"I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates."
4019,4019,Rachel,493,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",68,"What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!"
4020,4020,Chandler,577,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",69,"Alright, what have we learned so far?"
4022,4022,Ross,603,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",71,What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
4023,4023,Rachel,494,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",72,Was that the cake?
4024,4024,Ross,604,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",73,"Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush."
4025,4025,Monica,553,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",74,"Come on, she'll be here any minute."
4026,4026,Rachel,495,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",75,I hope it's okay.
4027,4027,Monica,554,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",76,Oh...

4029,4029,Monica,555,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",78,"Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses."
4030,4030,Ross,605,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",79,"(Still annoyed) Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools."
4031,4031,Phoebe,432,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",80,"Hey, what's going on?"
4032,4032,Ross,606,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",81,"Oh, we just..."

Oh my god! (Hugging people) This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, (still happy) Where's Joey?"
4035,4035,Chandler,579,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",84,Did you see Betty?
4037,4037,Ross,607,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",86,"Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?"
4039,4039,Ross,608,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",88,"Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a thing?"
4041,4041,Ross,609,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",90,"No, no, Dad, I was just wondering."
4043,4043,Ross,610,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",92,"Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?"
4046,4046,Ross,611,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",95,"No, we can go to Williamsburg."
4048,4048,Monica,556,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",97,"Rachel, the cute doctors are here."

4058,4058,Monica,559,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",107,It's uh...
4061,4061,Rachel,499,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",110,"Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine."
4062,4062,Monica,560,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",111,It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
4063,4063,Rachel,500,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",112,"Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?"
4064,4064,Monica,561,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",113,"A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?"
4070,4070,Monica,562,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",119,"I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby."
4071,4071,Rachel,501,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",120,"(Resenting the truth) I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we..."
4072,4072,Monica,563,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",121,"Sure, every time, you're such a princess..."
4073,4073,Rachel,502,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",122,You know what?
4074,4074,Monica,564,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",123,What?
4075,4075,Rachel,503,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",124,You know what?
4076,4076,Monica,565,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",125,What!?
4077,4077,Rachel,504,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",126,You know what?
4078,4078,Monica,566,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",127,(getting angry) What!!?
4079,4079,Rachel,505,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",128,"Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother."
4080,4080,Rachel,506,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",129,Hello! Here we go!
4082,4082,Rachel,507,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",131,"(as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago."
4083,4083,Monica,567,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",132,"(as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar."
4085,4085,Monica,568,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",134,"(as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?"
4087,4087,Rachel,508,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",136,"(as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown."
4089,4089,Rachel,509,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",138,"(as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do."
4092,4092,Monica,569,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",141,"(as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!"
4093,4093,Rachel,510,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",142,"(as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?"
4094,4094,Monica,570,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",143,(as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.
4095,4095,Rachel,511,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",144,(as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
4096,4096,Monica,571,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",145,(as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both do that!
4098,4098,Monica,572,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",147,"(as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you..."
4099,4099,Rachel,512,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",148,Would you excuse me for a second?
4100,4100,Monica,573,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",149,"(as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed."
4102,4102,Rachel,513,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",151,"(on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing ""You are..."") ...dead!"
4103,4103,Monica,574,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",152,"Ross, he's got the remote again."
4104,4104,Ross,612,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",153,Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
4105,4105,Ross,613,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",154,Maybe not.
4106,4106,Rachel,514,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",155,"Hello? (Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at Ross who takes the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV) Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here."
4107,4107,Rachel,515,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",156,"It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god..."
4109,4109,Monica,575,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",158,I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
4110,4110,Rachel,516,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",159,"Okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it."
4111,4111,Monica,576,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",160,"(taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank you. (Hangs up)"
4112,4112,Rachel,517,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",161,What?
4113,4113,Monica,577,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",162,We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
4114,4114,Rachel,518,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",163,"Ohhh... (slumping in relief) Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it."
4115,4115,Monica,578,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",164,Thank you.
4116,4116,Rachel,519,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",165,"Okay, let me just change."
4117,4117,Monica,579,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",166,Yes.
4118,4118,Joey,422,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",167,(entering quietly) Hey.
4120,4120,Monica,580,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",169,Hi.
4121,4121,Phoebe,434,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",170,Trouble?
4122,4122,Joey,423,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",171,Your sister stood me up the other night.
4123,4123,Phoebe,435,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",172,"Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?"
4124,4124,Ross,614,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",173,Well did you try calling her?
4125,4125,Joey,424,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",174,"I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off."
4126,4126,Phoebe,436,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",175,Hey.
4128,4128,Phoebe,437,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",177,"Um you, you got a minute?"
4130,4130,Phoebe,438,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",179,So.
4132,4132,Phoebe,439,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",181,"Um, oh, I got you a birthday present."
4134,4134,Phoebe,440,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",183,"Right, like the kind you..."
4136,4136,Phoebe,441,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",185,How'd you know I was coming?
4138,4138,Phoebe,442,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",187,I can't believe you did this.
4139,4139,Phoebe,443,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",188,I can't believe you... (holding up Joey's cardigan) ..did this.
4140,4140,Phoebe,444,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",189,"So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?"
4142,4142,Phoebe,445,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",191,Does he know?
4144,4144,Phoebe,446,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",193,"Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you."
4146,4146,Phoebe,447,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",195,You got me.
4149,4149,Phoebe,448,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",198,"So, um, are you gonna call him?"
4151,4151,Phoebe,449,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",200,"No, Joey."
4153,4153,Phoebe,450,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",202,No. No food with a face.
4155,4155,Phoebe,451,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",204,"Yeah, you too."
4156,4156,Rachel,520,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",205,"(as Monica) Hi, remember us?"
4158,4158,Monica,581,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",207,"(as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause um..."
4160,4160,Monica,582,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",209,(as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)
4161,4161,Rachel,521,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",210,"(as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check."
4163,4163,Rachel,522,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",212,"(as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not that bright either."
4164,4164,Chandler,580,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",213,"Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father."
4165,4165,Ross,615,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",214,Uh-huh.
4166,4166,Chandler,581,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",215,"Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this."
4167,4167,Ross,616,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",216,Do you have a point?
4168,4168,Chandler,582,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",217,"You know, you think I would."
4169,4169,Chandler,583,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",218,What's up with the simian?
4170,4170,Ross,617,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",219,It's just a fur ball.
4171,4171,Chandler,584,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",220,Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
4172,4172,Ross,618,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",221,"Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'."
4173,4173,Chandler,585,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",222,"No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'."
4174,4174,Ross,619,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",223,I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
4175,4175,Ross,620,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",224,You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
4177,4177,Ross,621,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",226,"No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do."
4178,4178,Monica,583,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",227,What's goin' on?
4179,4179,Chandler,586,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",228,Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
4180,4180,Rachel,523,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",229,Oh.
4182,4182,Ross,622,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",231,"Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!"
4185,4185,Monica,584,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",234,Michael.
4187,4187,Rachel,524,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",236,What?
4188,4188,Monica,585,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",237,(as Rachel) Monica.
4189,4189,Rachel,525,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",238,(as Monica) Oh.
4190,4190,Monica,586,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",239,(as Rachel) Hi.
4191,4191,Rachel,526,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",240,(as Monica) Hi.
4192,4192,Phoebe,452,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",241,(as Ursula) Hey.
4193,4193,Joey,425,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",242,Urse...
4194,4194,Joey,426,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",243,"..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you."
4195,4195,Phoebe,453,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",244,"(as Ursula) Listen, um..."
4196,4196,Joey,427,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",245,"No, no, no, don't say ""listen."" I know that ""listen."" I've said that ""listen."""
4197,4197,Phoebe,454,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",246,(as Ursula) I'm sorry.
4198,4198,Joey,428,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",247,I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
4199,4199,Phoebe,455,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",248,"(as Ursula): Yeah, um... (nervously clears her throat) You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!"
4200,4200,Joey,429,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",249,You don't drink.
4201,4201,Phoebe,456,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",250,"(as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!"
4202,4202,Joey,430,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",251,"Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)"
4203,4203,Phoebe,457,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",252,"(as Ursula) Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
4204,4204,Joey,431,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",253,Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
4205,4205,Phoebe,458,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",254,"(as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
4206,4206,Joey,432,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",255,"(Thinking carefully) no. No, I, I couldn't do that."
4207,4207,Phoebe,459,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",256,"(as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me."
4208,4208,Joey,433,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",257,"Then, uh, then I'm sorry."
4209,4209,Phoebe,460,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",258,"(as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee) You're gonna be really, really hard to get over."
4210,4210,Joey,434,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",259,I know...
4211,4211,Joey,435,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",260,"I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful."
4212,4212,Phoebe,461,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",261,Really?
4213,4213,Joey,436,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",262,Pheebs?
4214,4214,Phoebe,462,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",263,(Automatically) Yeah. Oooh... (she's sprung.)
4215,4215,Ross,623,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",264,He looks so tiny.
4216,4216,Joey,437,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",265,We just got the message.
4217,4217,Phoebe,463,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",266,Is he alright?
4218,4218,Ross,624,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",267,Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
4219,4219,Chandler,587,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",268,We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
4220,4220,Ross,625,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",269,"Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now."
4221,4221,Chandler,588,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",270,"(Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?"
4222,4222,Ross,626,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",271,"No, why?"
4223,4223,Chandler,589,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",272,"Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad."
4224,4224,Monica,587,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",273,"Oh, look, he's waking up!"
4225,4225,Ross,627,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",274,"(Quietly) hey, fella! How you doing?"
4227,4227,Ross,628,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",276,Aqui est�. (Here it is!)
4228,4228,Monica,588,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",277,�A qui�n pidio el pollo General Tso? (Who ordered General Sal's chicken?)
4229,4229,Chandler,590,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",278,�Pudo aver sido General Tso! (It could've been General Sal!)
4230,4230,Rachel,527,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",279,"�Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo est� haciendo el hula hoop! (Look, look, Ugly Naked Guy is doing the hula!)"
4233,4233,Joey,438,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",282,"�Hola, amigos! (Hey, everybody!)"
4234,4234,Monica,589,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",283,"Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto. (Look, Ross, Marcel's got the remote.)"
4235,4235,Ross,629,1,17,"The Two Parts, Part II",284,"�Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele! (The thing is, he doesn`t like the program!)"
4236,4236,Ross,630,1,18,All The Poker,0,"Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here."
4237,4237,Monica,590,1,18,All The Poker,1,Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
4238,4238,Chandler,591,1,18,All The Poker,2,"Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for."
4239,4239,Rachel,528,1,18,All The Poker,3,"Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'"
4240,4240,Ross,631,1,18,All The Poker,4,"Rach, did you proofread these?"
4241,4241,Rachel,529,1,18,All The Poker,5,"Uh... yeah, why?"
4242,4242,Ross,632,1,18,All The Poker,6,"Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills."
4243,4243,Rachel,530,1,18,All The Poker,7,"(upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?"
4244,4244,Joey,439,1,18,All The Poker,8,"Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few."
4246,4246,Monica,591,1,18,All The Poker,10,"Hey, guys."
4248,4248,Rachel,531,1,18,All The Poker,12,"Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? (to Monica, quietly): Did you bring the mail?"
4249,4249,Monica,592,1,18,All The Poker,13,Lots of responses.
4250,4250,Rachel,532,1,18,All The Poker,14,"(to Monica): Really? (out loud): Sure, we have scones left! (to Monica): OK, read them to me."
4251,4251,Phoebe,464,1,18,All The Poker,15,"(reading): Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh... (crumples up letter)"
4252,4252,Rachel,533,1,18,All The Poker,16,(out loud): We have apple cinnamon...
4253,4253,Monica,593,1,18,All The Poker,17,(reading): OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. (crumpes up letter)
4254,4254,Phoebe,465,1,18,All The Poker,18,Wow!
4255,4255,Rachel,534,1,18,All The Poker,19,What?
4256,4256,Phoebe,466,1,18,All The Poker,20,(reading): Your Visa bill is huge!
4257,4257,Rachel,535,1,18,All The Poker,21,(grabs the bill) Give me that!
4258,4258,Chandler,592,1,18,All The Poker,22,"You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?"
4259,4259,Ross,633,1,18,All The Poker,23,I don't know.
4260,4260,Chandler,593,1,18,All The Poker,24,Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
4261,4261,Ross,634,1,18,All The Poker,25,"No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins to stare lovingly at Rachel)"
4262,4262,Chandler,594,1,18,All The Poker,26,...little playthings with yarn?
4263,4263,Ross,635,1,18,All The Poker,27,What?
4264,4264,Chandler,595,1,18,All The Poker,28,Could you want her more?
4265,4265,Ross,636,1,18,All The Poker,29,Who?
4266,4266,Chandler,596,1,18,All The Poker,30,"(sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening."
4267,4267,Ross,637,1,18,All The Poker,31,"Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over, Ross lays head on table): Hiiii!"
4268,4268,Rachel,536,1,18,All The Poker,32,Hi! How are you?
4269,4269,Ross,638,1,18,All The Poker,33,"We're fine, we're fine."
4270,4270,Rachel,537,1,18,All The Poker,34,OK. (walks away)
4271,4271,Joey,440,1,18,All The Poker,35,Shut up!
4272,4272,Chandler,597,1,18,All The Poker,36,We're notwe're not saying anything.
4273,4273,Phoebe,467,1,18,All The Poker,37,What?
4274,4274,Ross,639,1,18,All The Poker,38,Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
4275,4275,Joey,441,1,18,All The Poker,39,Thank you.
4276,4276,Chandler,598,1,18,All The Poker,40,"(to the girls) We were playing poker, alright..."
4277,4277,Joey,442,1,18,All The Poker,41,"There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?"
4278,4278,Ross,640,1,18,All The Poker,42,"Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'"
4279,4279,Chandler,599,1,18,All The Poker,43,And then he did.
4280,4280,Rachel,538,1,18,All The Poker,44,"Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?"
4281,4281,Phoebe,468,1,18,All The Poker,45,"Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?"
4282,4282,Ross,641,1,18,All The Poker,46,"No, women are welcome to play."
4283,4283,Phoebe,469,1,18,All The Poker,47,"Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?"
4284,4284,Chandler,600,1,18,All The Poker,48,There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
4285,4285,Joey,443,1,18,All The Poker,49,"Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker."
4287,4287,Monica,594,1,18,All The Poker,51,"Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!"
4288,4288,Rachel,539,1,18,All The Poker,52,Really.
4289,4289,Monica,595,1,18,All The Poker,53,"I mean, that's a typical guy response."
4290,4290,Ross,642,1,18,All The Poker,54,"Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?"
4292,4292,Rachel,540,1,18,All The Poker,56,But you could teach us.
4294,4294,Chandler,601,1,18,All The Poker,58,"(teaching) OK, so now we draw cards."
4295,4295,Monica,596,1,18,All The Poker,59,"So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight."
4296,4296,Rachel,541,1,18,All The Poker,60,"Oh, good for you!"
4297,4297,Phoebe,470,1,18,All The Poker,61,Congratulations!
4298,4298,Chandler,602,1,18,All The Poker,62,"OK Phoebs, how many do you want?"
4299,4299,Phoebe,471,1,18,All The Poker,63,"OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs."
4300,4300,Ross,643,1,18,All The Poker,64,"No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do..."
4301,4301,Rachel,542,1,18,All The Poker,65,"Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)"
4302,4302,Rachel,543,1,18,All The Poker,66,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours."
4303,4303,Ross,644,1,18,All The Poker,67,"Oh, you're... (gives up)"
4304,4304,Monica,597,1,18,All The Poker,68,"Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites."
4306,4306,Joey,444,1,18,All The Poker,70,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization)"
4307,4307,Chandler,603,1,18,All The Poker,71,"(changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer..."
4308,4308,Monica,598,1,18,All The Poker,72,"Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks..."
4309,4309,Ross,645,1,18,All The Poker,73,"Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy..."
4310,4310,Phoebe,472,1,18,All The Poker,74,"But... I'm ready, so, just deal."
4311,4311,Chandler,604,1,18,All The Poker,75,"OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the cards."
4312,4312,Monica,599,1,18,All The Poker,76,"(throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!"
4313,4313,Phoebe,473,1,18,All The Poker,77,"(to Joey): Oh I see, so then, you were lying."
4314,4314,Joey,445,1,18,All The Poker,78,About what?
4315,4315,Phoebe,474,1,18,All The Poker,79,About how good your cards were.
4316,4316,Joey,446,1,18,All The Poker,80,Heh... I was bluffing.
4317,4317,Phoebe,475,1,18,All The Poker,81,A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
4318,4318,Rachel,544,1,18,All The Poker,82,"OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)"
4320,4320,Chandler,605,1,18,All The Poker,84,"Rach, Rach, we gotta settle."
4321,4321,Rachel,545,1,18,All The Poker,85,Settle what?
4322,4322,Chandler,606,1,18,All The Poker,86,"The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so..."
4323,4323,Ross,646,1,18,All The Poker,87,"The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game."
4324,4324,Rachel,546,1,18,All The Poker,88,Oh. Right.
4325,4325,Joey,447,1,18,All The Poker,89,"You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?"
4326,4326,Monica,600,1,18,All The Poker,90,"Hell no, we'll pay!"
4327,4327,Phoebe,476,1,18,All The Poker,91,"OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready."
4328,4328,Monica,601,1,18,All The Poker,92,And you know what? We want a rematch.
4329,4329,Ross,647,1,18,All The Poker,93,Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
4330,4330,Rachel,547,1,18,All The Poker,94,"(to Ross): So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends."
4331,4331,Ross,648,1,18,All The Poker,95,(pause)...Yeah.
4332,4332,Chandler,607,1,18,All The Poker,96,"Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less."
4333,4333,Ross,649,1,18,All The Poker,97,"Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)"
4334,4334,Joey,448,1,18,All The Poker,98,(pause)...Yeah?
4335,4335,Ross,650,1,18,All The Poker,99,I'm not a nice guy.
4336,4336,Ross,651,1,18,All The Poker,100,"Alright boys, let's eat."
4337,4337,Chandler,608,1,18,All The Poker,101,"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
4338,4338,Ross,652,1,18,All The Poker,102,You still on that?
4339,4339,Chandler,609,1,18,All The Poker,103,"Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking): ""When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"""
4340,4340,Ross,653,1,18,All The Poker,104,"You are way off, pal."
4341,4341,Joey,449,1,18,All The Poker,105,"No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."
4342,4342,Ross,654,1,18,All The Poker,106,"Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI..."
4343,4343,Ross,655,1,18,All The Poker,107,Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
4344,4344,Ross,656,1,18,All The Poker,108,"You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble."
4345,4345,Rachel,548,1,18,All The Poker,109,(opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
4346,4346,Monica,602,1,18,All The Poker,110,"Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive."
4347,4347,Phoebe,477,1,18,All The Poker,111,"Ha. Ha, ha."
4348,4348,Monica,603,1,18,All The Poker,112,What?
4349,4349,Phoebe,478,1,18,All The Poker,113,"Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black."
4350,4350,Monica,604,1,18,All The Poker,114,Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
4351,4351,Rachel,549,1,18,All The Poker,115,"Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?"
4352,4352,Monica,605,1,18,All The Poker,116,"That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand."
4353,4353,Rachel,550,1,18,All The Poker,117,Oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised): Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
4354,4354,Monica,606,1,18,All The Poker,118,You're kidding! Where? Where?
4355,4355,Rachel,551,1,18,All The Poker,119,(in disbelief): Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
4356,4356,Monica,607,1,18,All The Poker,120,"Oh, Rachel!"
4357,4357,Phoebe,479,1,18,All The Poker,121,"Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home."
4358,4358,Monica,608,1,18,All The Poker,122,"Well, what's the job?"
4359,4359,Rachel,552,1,18,All The Poker,123,Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
4360,4360,Monica,609,1,18,All The Poker,124,"OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!"
4362,4362,Rachel,553,1,18,All The Poker,126,No.
4363,4363,Monica,610,1,18,All The Poker,127,I don't think so.
4364,4364,Rachel,554,1,18,All The Poker,128,Why?
4366,4366,Monica,611,1,18,All The Poker,130,What?
4367,4367,Rachel,555,1,18,All The Poker,131,Oh my God!
4368,4368,Monica,612,1,18,All The Poker,132,Really?
4370,4370,Phoebe,480,1,18,All The Poker,134,Thank y... (thinks about it)
4372,4372,Monica,613,1,18,All The Poker,136,"Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel..."
4374,4374,Phoebe,481,1,18,All The Poker,138,"Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?"
4375,4375,Ross,657,1,18,All The Poker,139,Alright.
4376,4376,Ross,658,1,18,All The Poker,140,I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
4377,4377,Rachel,556,1,18,All The Poker,141,Hi!
4378,4378,Ross,659,1,18,All The Poker,142,Hey.
4379,4379,Rachel,557,1,18,All The Poker,143,"Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!"
4380,4380,Chandler,610,1,18,All The Poker,144,"Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?"
4381,4381,Rachel,558,1,18,All The Poker,145,"Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!"
4383,4383,Rachel,559,1,18,All The Poker,147,"Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story..."
4384,4384,Monica,614,1,18,All The Poker,148,"OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker."
4385,4385,Joey,450,1,18,All The Poker,149,"Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand."
4386,4386,Chandler,611,1,18,All The Poker,150,"Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?"
4387,4387,Monica,615,1,18,All The Poker,151,"Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?"
4389,4389,Ross,660,1,18,All The Poker,153,"Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?"
4390,4390,Rachel,560,1,18,All The Poker,154,"No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go."
4391,4391,Ross,661,1,18,All The Poker,155,Alright.
4392,4392,Rachel,561,1,18,All The Poker,156,"Alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)"
4394,4394,Ross,662,1,18,All The Poker,158,"So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones."
4395,4395,Joey,451,1,18,All The Poker,159,"But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game."
4396,4396,Phoebe,482,1,18,All The Poker,160,"Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you should know that this money is cursed."
4397,4397,Joey,452,1,18,All The Poker,161,What?
4398,4398,Phoebe,483,1,18,All The Poker,162,"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
4399,4399,Chandler,612,1,18,All The Poker,163,"That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie."
4400,4400,Ross,663,1,18,All The Poker,164,"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen..."
4401,4401,Rachel,562,1,18,All The Poker,165,"Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)"
4402,4402,Monica,616,1,18,All The Poker,166,"You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever."
4403,4403,Rachel,563,1,18,All The Poker,167,"Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon."
4404,4404,Ross,664,1,18,All The Poker,168,"So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing."
4405,4405,Rachel,564,1,18,All The Poker,169,"Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy."
4406,4406,Monica,617,1,18,All The Poker,170,"OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?"
4407,4407,Phoebe,484,1,18,All The Poker,171,"(holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker."
4408,4408,Monica,618,1,18,All The Poker,172,"Excuse me, where are you going?"
4409,4409,Ross,665,1,18,All The Poker,173,Uh... to the bathroom.
4410,4410,Monica,619,1,18,All The Poker,174,"Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?"
4411,4411,Ross,666,1,18,All The Poker,175,I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)
4412,4412,Joey,453,1,18,All The Poker,176,"Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)"
4413,4413,Rachel,565,1,18,All The Poker,177,"Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then."
4414,4414,Joey,454,1,18,All The Poker,178,That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
4415,4415,Monica,620,1,18,All The Poker,179,"Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)"
4416,4416,Phoebe,485,1,18,All The Poker,180,(looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.
4417,4417,Ross,667,1,18,All The Poker,181,"Alright. (to Rachel): Your money's mine, Green."
4418,4418,Rachel,566,1,18,All The Poker,182,"Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)"
4419,4419,Phoebe,486,1,18,All The Poker,183,"You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?"
4420,4420,Chandler,613,1,18,All The Poker,184,"Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
4421,4421,Joey,455,1,18,All The Poker,185,Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?

4427,4427,Rachel,568,1,18,All The Poker,191,"Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays down cards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing): Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it..."
4428,4428,Rachel,569,1,18,All The Poker,192,And your fly's still open...
4429,4429,Rachel,570,1,18,All The Poker,193,"Ha, I made you look...."

4431,4431,Phoebe,488,1,18,All The Poker,195,"Monica, in or out?"
4432,4432,Monica,622,1,18,All The Poker,196,(slams down cards) I hate this game!
4433,4433,Phoebe,489,1,18,All The Poker,197,"OK Joey, your bet."
4434,4434,Joey,457,1,18,All The Poker,198,"Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out."
4435,4435,Phoebe,490,1,18,All The Poker,199,Ross?

4440,4440,Rachel,572,1,18,All The Poker,204,"Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do you say... want to waste another buck?"
4441,4441,Ross,670,1,18,All The Poker,205,"No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?"
4442,4442,Rachel,573,1,18,All The Poker,206,I'm not telling. (collects chips)
4443,4443,Ross,671,1,18,All The Poker,207,"Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)"
4444,4444,Rachel,574,1,18,All The Poker,208,No..!

4448,4448,Chandler,615,1,18,All The Poker,212,"Y'know, I've had dates like this."
4449,4449,Rachel,576,1,18,All The Poker,213,"(deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple..."
4450,4450,Phoebe,493,1,18,All The Poker,214,Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
4451,4451,Ross,674,1,18,All The Poker,215,"First of all, I'm not losing..."
4452,4452,Rachel,577,1,18,All The Poker,216,"Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. (phone rings)"
4453,4453,Ross,675,1,18,All The Poker,217,Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
4454,4454,Rachel,578,1,18,All The Poker,218,"(answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green."
4455,4455,Ross,676,1,18,All The Poker,219,"(mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee."
4456,4456,Rachel,579,1,18,All The Poker,220,(on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about the job.
4457,4457,Rachel,580,1,18,All The Poker,221,"Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)"
4458,4458,Monica,623,1,18,All The Poker,222,"Sorry, Rach."
4459,4459,Phoebe,494,1,18,All The Poker,223,"Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff."
4460,4460,Rachel,581,1,18,All The Poker,224,"Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante."
4461,4461,Joey,458,1,18,All The Poker,225,"Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this."
4462,4462,Rachel,582,1,18,All The Poker,226,"Yes, we do. (pause)"
4463,4463,Monica,624,1,18,All The Poker,227,"Alright, check."

4469,4469,Ross,678,1,18,All The Poker,233,"I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit."
4470,4470,Rachel,584,1,18,All The Poker,234,"Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?"
4471,4471,Rachel,585,1,18,All The Poker,235,(to Ross): Loser?
4472,4472,Ross,679,1,18,All The Poker,236,"No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)"
4473,4473,Rachel,586,1,18,All The Poker,237,"What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?"
4474,4474,Ross,680,1,18,All The Poker,238,I'm in. (throws in chips)
4475,4475,Rachel,587,1,18,All The Poker,239,How many you want?

4477,4477,Rachel,588,1,18,All The Poker,241,Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?
4478,4478,Ross,682,1,18,All The Poker,242,I bet two dollars. (throws it in)
4479,4479,Rachel,589,1,18,All The Poker,243,OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)

4481,4481,Rachel,590,1,18,All The Poker,245,"See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse."
4482,4482,Monica,625,1,18,All The Poker,246,"Rachel, there's nothing in it."
4483,4483,Rachel,591,1,18,All The Poker,247,"OK, then get me your purse."
4484,4484,Monica,626,1,18,All The Poker,248,"OK, here you go. Good luck."

4487,4487,Ross,684,1,18,All The Poker,251,"(to Joey): Joey, I'm a little shy."
4488,4488,Joey,460,1,18,All The Poker,252,"That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?"
4489,4489,Chandler,617,1,18,All The Poker,253,"(to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?"
4490,4490,Ross,685,1,18,All The Poker,254,Fifteen.
4491,4491,Chandler,618,1,18,All The Poker,255,"Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)"
4492,4492,Joey,461,1,18,All The Poker,256,"Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)"

4498,4498,Joey,462,1,18,All The Poker,262,"(to Ross): Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat."
4499,4499,Chandler,620,1,18,All The Poker,263,(to Ross): I thought we had them!
4500,4500,Ross,689,1,18,All The Poker,264,"Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)"
4502,4502,Chandler,621,1,18,All The Poker,266,Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
4503,4503,Rachel,594,1,18,All The Poker,267,"Oh, time's up."
4504,4504,Monica,627,1,18,All The Poker,268,"(pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE."
4505,4505,Joey,463,1,18,All The Poker,269,Oh!
4506,4506,Phoebe,497,1,18,All The Poker,270,That's a bird?
4507,4507,Phoebe,498,1,18,All The Poker,271,That's a bird!
4508,4508,Rachel,595,1,18,All The Poker,272,"OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)"
4509,4509,Chandler,622,1,18,All The Poker,273,Go.
4510,4510,Ross,690,1,18,All The Poker,274,Uh.... bean! Bean!
4511,4511,Joey,464,1,18,All The Poker,275,(triumphantly) The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
4512,4512,Rachel,596,1,18,All The Poker,276,Yes!
4513,4513,Monica,628,1,18,All The Poker,277,"That, you get? That, you get?"
4515,4515,Rachel,597,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,1,"Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? (Guy shakes his head) Okay."
4517,4517,Monica,629,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,3,"Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven."
4518,4518,Rachel,598,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,4,"Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!"
4519,4519,Monica,630,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,5,Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
4520,4520,Rachel,599,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,6,Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
4521,4521,Monica,631,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,7,What is it?
4522,4522,Rachel,600,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,8,"Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!"
4523,4523,Monica,632,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,9,Barry who you almost...?
4524,4524,Rachel,601,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,10,Barry who I almost.
4525,4525,Monica,633,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,11,"And Mindy, your maid of...?"
4526,4526,Rachel,602,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,12,"Mindy, my maid of. Oh!"
4527,4527,Monica,634,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,13,"(Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky. To have had a friend like you."
4528,4528,Ross,691,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,14,"Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachel ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?"
4529,4529,Rachel,603,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,15,What?
4530,4530,Ross,692,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,16,Hi.
4531,4531,Rachel,604,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,17,"Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them."
4532,4532,Ross,693,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,18,Really.
4533,4533,Rachel,605,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,19,"No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody."
4534,4534,Ross,694,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,20,"Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?"
4535,4535,Rachel,606,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,21,"Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual..."
4536,4536,Ross,695,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,22,"Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there."
4537,4537,Rachel,607,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,23,"Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?"
4538,4538,Ross,696,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,24,"Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who..."
4539,4539,Monica,635,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,25,Hi.
4540,4540,Ross,697,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,26,...Gets interrupted. Hi!
4541,4541,Rachel,608,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,27,"Hi, how was the movie?"
4542,4542,Monica,636,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,28,Wonderful!
4543,4543,Phoebe,499,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,29,So good!
4544,4544,Joey,465,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,30,Suck-fest.
4545,4545,Chandler,623,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,31,Toootal chick-flick.
4546,4546,Phoebe,500,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,32,"I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast..."
4547,4547,Joey,466,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,33,"Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity."
4548,4548,Monica,637,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,34,There was nudity!
4549,4549,Joey,467,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,35,I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
4551,4551,Ross,698,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,37,"Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are."
4552,4552,Chandler,624,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,38,"They're still just friends, right?"
4553,4553,Rachel,609,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,39,(To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow!
4554,4554,Ross,699,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,40,"That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you."
4555,4555,Monica,638,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,41,"Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?"
4556,4556,Ross,700,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,42,"'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there."
4557,4557,Chandler,625,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,43,I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
4558,4558,Joey,468,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,44,"I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief."
4559,4559,Chandler,626,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,45,"I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?"
4560,4560,Ross,701,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,46,"I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me."
4561,4561,Joey,469,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,47,She really said that?
4562,4562,Ross,702,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,48,"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
4563,4563,Joey,470,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,49,'Tonight' tonight?
4564,4564,Ross,703,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,50,"Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey..."
4565,4565,Chandler,627,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,51,I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
4566,4566,Ross,704,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,52,"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her."
4567,4567,Chandler,628,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,53,"Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used."
4568,4568,Rachel,610,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,54,"Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the open door)"
4569,4569,Joey,471,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,55,How could you lose him?
4570,4570,Rachel,611,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,56,"I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-"
4571,4571,Monica,639,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,57,Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
4572,4572,Rachel,612,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,58,I don't know. The left one.
4573,4573,Monica,640,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,59,Which ones?
4574,4574,Rachel,613,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,60,"Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything."
4575,4575,Phoebe,501,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,61,(Entering) Hey.
4577,4577,Phoebe,502,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,63,"Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?"
4578,4578,Chandler,629,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,64,Rachel lost Marcel.
4579,4579,Phoebe,503,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,65,"Oh no, how?"
4580,4580,Monica,641,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,66,He- he pooped in my shoe.
4581,4581,Phoebe,504,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,67,Which one?
4582,4582,Monica,642,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,68,Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
4583,4583,Phoebe,505,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,69,"No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky..."
4584,4584,Rachel,614,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,70,"C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?"
4585,4585,Joey,472,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,71,Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
4586,4586,Chandler,630,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,72,"Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room."
4587,4587,Rachel,615,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,73,"Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!"
4588,4588,Monica,643,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,74,"Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth."
4589,4589,Rachel,616,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,75,"Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?"
4590,4590,Monica,644,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,76,"Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you."
4591,4591,Rachel,617,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,77,Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
4593,4593,Monica,645,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,79,"Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?"
4595,4595,Monica,646,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,81,No!
4596,4596,Phoebe,506,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,82,Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
4598,4598,Monica,647,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,84,A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
4600,4600,Phoebe,507,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,86,"Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. (They move off)"
4602,4602,Rachel,618,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,88,"(On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks."
4603,4603,Ross,705,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,89,"Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?"
4604,4604,Rachel,619,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,90,"Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?"
4605,4605,Ross,706,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,91,"Yeah. You, uh, you want some?"
4606,4606,Rachel,620,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,92,"Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?"
4607,4607,Ross,707,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,93,"Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine) Well-"
4608,4608,Rachel,621,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,94,"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this."
4609,4609,Ross,708,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,95,"Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine)"
4610,4610,Rachel,622,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,96,"Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me."
4611,4611,Ross,709,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,97,"Oh, what? What-what?"
4612,4612,Rachel,623,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,98,Y'know Marcel?
4613,4613,Ross,710,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,99,...Yeah?
4614,4614,Rachel,624,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,100,"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him."
4616,4616,Ross,711,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,102,"(Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment."
4617,4617,Rachel,625,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,103,"I know, I know, I'm sorry-"
4618,4618,Ross,712,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,104,"No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil."
4619,4619,Rachel,626,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,105,"(Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?"
4621,4621,Rachel,627,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,107,See? I've even called Animal Control!
4622,4622,Ross,713,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,108,You called Animal Control?
4623,4623,Rachel,628,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,109,Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
4624,4624,Ross,714,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,110,"Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me."
4625,4625,Rachel,629,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,111,"O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that..."
4626,4626,Ross,715,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,112,"That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!"
4627,4627,Rachel,630,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,113,"Hi, thanks for coming."
4629,4629,Rachel,631,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,115,"Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)"
4630,4630,Ross,716,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,116,"Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't."
4631,4631,Rachel,632,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,117,Turned out it was a hat.
4632,4632,Ross,717,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,118,Cat!
4633,4633,Rachel,633,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,119,Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
4634,4634,Monica,648,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,120,"Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel."
4636,4636,Ross,718,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,122,My uncle Marcel.
4637,4637,Phoebe,508,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,123,"Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?"
4639,4639,Phoebe,509,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,125,Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
4640,4640,Monica,649,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,126,"Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?"
4641,4641,Phoebe,510,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,127,"Yes, but there isn't always time!"
4642,4642,Monica,650,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,128,"Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller."
4644,4644,Rachel,634,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,130,Yeah!
4646,4646,Rachel,635,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,132,Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
4647,4647,Monica,651,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,133,The Luisa from home room!
4648,4648,Rachel,636,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,134,Yes!!
4650,4650,Monica,652,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,136,"No, none at all."
4651,4651,Rachel,637,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,137,None.
4653,4653,Monica,653,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,139,"Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!"
4655,4655,Rachel,638,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,141,What?!
4656,4656,Monica,654,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,142,"Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?"
4658,4658,Phoebe,511,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,144,Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
4659,4659,Chandler,631,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,145,Marcel?
4660,4660,Joey,473,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,146,Marcel?
4661,4661,Chandler,632,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,147,Marcel?
4662,4662,Joey,474,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,148,Marcel?
4664,4664,Chandler,633,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,150,"Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something..."
4665,4665,Joey,475,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,151,A monkey.
4666,4666,Chandler,634,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,152,Yes have you seen any?
4668,4668,Joey,476,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,154,"Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?"
4670,4670,Joey,477,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,156,"Oh. Then, no."
4673,4673,Chandler,635,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,159,"Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu."
4674,4674,Joey,478,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,160,"Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?"
4675,4675,Chandler,636,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,161,"Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot."
4676,4676,Joey,479,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,162,"We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out."
4677,4677,Chandler,637,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,163,"Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people."
4678,4678,Joey,480,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,164,Marcel?
4679,4679,Chandler,638,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,165,Marcel?!
4680,4680,Phoebe,512,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,166,Marcel?
4681,4681,Monica,655,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,167,Marcel?
4682,4682,Phoebe,513,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,168,Marcel?
4684,4684,Phoebe,514,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,170,Oh-my-God!
4685,4685,Monica,656,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,171,Whaaat!
4686,4686,Phoebe,515,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,172,Something just brushed up against my right leg!
4687,4687,Monica,657,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,173,What is it?
4688,4688,Phoebe,516,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,174,"Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg."
4689,4689,Monica,658,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,175,"Look, Phoebe!"
4690,4690,Phoebe,517,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,176,"Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!"
4692,4692,Monica,659,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,178,What're you gonna do?
4694,4694,Monica,660,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,180,"Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?"
4695,4695,Phoebe,518,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,181,"Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah."
4696,4696,Monica,661,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,182,Oh gosh.
4697,4697,Ross,719,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,183,Marcel?
4698,4698,Rachel,639,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,184,Marcel?
4699,4699,Ross,720,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,185,"Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone."
4700,4700,Rachel,640,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,186,"Ross, you don't know that."
4701,4701,Ross,721,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,187,"Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much."
4702,4702,Rachel,641,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,188,"Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!"
4703,4703,Ross,722,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,189,"Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!"
4704,4704,Rachel,642,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,190,"Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose."
4705,4705,Ross,723,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,191,"Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings..."
4706,4706,Rachel,643,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,192,Ross.
4707,4707,Ross,724,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,193,"I don't even wanna hear it, you're just..."
4708,4708,Rachel,644,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,194,Ross.
4709,4709,Ross,725,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,195,"Oh, forget it, okay?"
4710,4710,Rachel,645,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,196,Ross!
4711,4711,Ross,726,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,197,What? What?
4713,4713,Phoebe,519,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,199,"Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea."
4714,4714,Ross,727,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,200,"Hi, did you order some bananas?"
4716,4716,Ross,728,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,202,Gimme back my monkey.
4718,4718,Rachel,646,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,204,Then what's with all the bananas?
4720,4720,Ross,729,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,206,"Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?"
4721,4721,Ross,730,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,207,Marcel! What've you done to him?
4723,4723,Ross,731,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,209,"Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)"
4725,4725,Ross,732,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,211,"C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)"
4728,4728,Ross,733,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,214,"Okay, gimme my monkey back."
4732,4732,Ross,734,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,218,"Alright, I want my monkey."
4734,4734,Rachel,647,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,220,"Oh, c'mon, Luisa!"
4736,4736,Ross,735,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,222,"(To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat."
4737,4737,Rachel,648,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,223,"Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!"
4739,4739,Rachel,649,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,225,"Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?"
4740,4740,Ross,736,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,226,"It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine."
4741,4741,Rachel,650,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,227,"Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit."
4742,4742,Ross,737,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,228,"Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I..."
4743,4743,Rachel,651,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,229,"Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your..."
4744,4744,Ross,738,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,230,"Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?"
4745,4745,Rachel,652,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,231,That'd be good.
4746,4746,Ross,739,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,232,"Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um..."
4748,4748,Rachel,653,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,234,Barry?!
4751,4751,Ross,740,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,237,We have got to start locking that door!
4753,4753,Monica,662,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,239,This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
4754,4754,Phoebe,520,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,240,Nope.
4755,4755,Monica,663,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,241,That's because I'm in front of them.
4756,4756,Chandler,639,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,242,Eh. I thought that was an alp.
4757,4757,Monica,664,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,243,"Well, high school was not my favourite time."
4758,4758,Joey,481,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,244,"I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex."
4759,4759,Chandler,640,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,245,"Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice."
4760,4760,Monica,665,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,246,"Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?"
4761,4761,Phoebe,521,1,19,The Monkey Gets Away,247,Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
4762,4762,Chandler,641,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,0,I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
4763,4763,Joey,482,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,1,"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is."
4764,4764,Ross,741,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,2,"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy."
4765,4765,Monica,666,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,3,(looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
4766,4766,Ross,742,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,4,I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
4767,4767,Rachel,654,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,5,"Oh, that is so sick."
4768,4768,Chandler,642,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,6,I feel violated. And not in a good way.
4769,4769,Phoebe,522,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,7,"How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!"
4771,4771,Chandler,643,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,9,"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
4772,4772,Monica,667,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,10,So have you called her yet?
4773,4773,Chandler,644,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,11,"Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?"
4775,4775,Monica,668,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,13,I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
4776,4776,Phoebe,523,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,14,"Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!"
4777,4777,Chandler,645,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,15,"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine."
4778,4778,Joey,483,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,16,Her answer machine?
4779,4779,Chandler,646,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,17,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
4780,4780,Phoebe,524,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,18,"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?"
4781,4781,Chandler,647,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,19,"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
4782,4782,Monica,669,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,20,"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!"
4783,4783,Ross,743,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,21,"Okay, okay, what's going on?"
4784,4784,Phoebe,525,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,22,"Okay, they're just talking..."
4785,4785,Ross,744,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,23,"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?"
4786,4786,Phoebe,526,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,24,"No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!"
4787,4787,Ross,745,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,25,What? What? What?!
4788,4788,Phoebe,527,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,26,That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!
4789,4789,Chandler,648,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,27,"(bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law."
4791,4791,Chandler,649,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,29,Hey Rach!
4792,4792,Monica,670,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,30,How'd it go?
4793,4793,Rachel,655,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,31,"Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out..."
4794,4794,Phoebe,528,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,32,Not a good day for birds...
4795,4795,Rachel,656,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,33,"Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel..."
4796,4796,Ross,746,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,34,"That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?"
4797,4797,Rachel,657,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,35,"Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!"
4798,4798,Ross,747,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,36,"That's, that's nice twice!"
4799,4799,Monica,671,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,37,"Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?"
4800,4800,Joey,484,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,38,"Duh, where've you been?"
4801,4801,Rachel,658,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,39,"Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?"
4802,4802,Chandler,650,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,40,Yes!
4803,4803,Rachel,659,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,41,Why?
4804,4804,Chandler,651,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,42,I have my reasons.
4805,4805,Monica,672,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,43,"Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?"
4806,4806,Rachel,660,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,44,"All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!"
4807,4807,Rachel,661,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,45,Wow... Wow!
4809,4809,Rachel,662,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,47,"I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that."
4811,4811,Rachel,663,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,49,"Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here..."
4812,4812,Chandler,652,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,50,"(on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!"
4813,4813,Monica,673,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,51,That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
4814,4814,Chandler,653,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,52,"Hey, I've been honing!"
4815,4815,Ross,748,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,53,What was with the dishes?
4816,4816,Chandler,654,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,54,"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours."
4817,4817,Monica,674,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,55,"(looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!"
4818,4818,Phoebe,529,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,56,Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here!
4819,4819,Monica,675,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,57,"Great, now he's waving back."
4820,4820,Joey,485,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,58,"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
4821,4821,Monica,676,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,59,What kinda stuff?
4822,4822,Joey,486,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,60,"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked."
4823,4823,Phoebe,530,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,61,You cook naked?
4824,4824,Joey,487,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,62,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters."
4825,4825,Chandler,655,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,63,What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
4827,4827,Rachel,664,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,65,"Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
4829,4829,Rachel,665,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,67,"Well, what about Mindy?"
4831,4831,Rachel,666,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,69,"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
4833,4833,Rachel,667,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,71,"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me."
4836,4836,Rachel,668,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,74,"Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.."
4838,4838,Rachel,669,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,76,I had a bra.
4841,4841,Rachel,670,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,79,What?!
4843,4843,Chandler,656,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,81,Can I use your phone?
4844,4844,Monica,677,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,82,"Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone."
4845,4845,Chandler,657,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,83,"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?"
4846,4846,Joey,488,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,84,Maybe she never got your message.
4847,4847,Phoebe,531,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,85,"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
4848,4848,Chandler,658,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,86,Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
4849,4849,Ross,749,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,87,"...desperate, needy, pathetic?"
4850,4850,Chandler,659,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,88,"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad."
4851,4851,Phoebe,532,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,89,How many beeps?
4852,4852,Chandler,660,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,90,She answered.
4853,4853,Monica,678,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,91,"Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."
4854,4854,Chandler,661,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,92,"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy."
4856,4856,Phoebe,533,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,94,How'd he take it?
4857,4857,Rachel,671,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,95,"Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)"
4858,4858,Monica,679,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,96,"(wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?"
4859,4859,Rachel,672,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,97,"Oh, do I?"
4860,4860,Monica,680,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,98,Uh huh.
4861,4861,Rachel,673,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,99,(in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.
4862,4862,Monica,681,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,100,"You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?"
4863,4863,Ross,750,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,101,You-you had what?
4864,4864,Phoebe,534,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,102,Sex in his chair.
4865,4865,Ross,751,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,103,"What, uh... what were you thinking?"
4866,4866,Rachel,674,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,104,"I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol."
4867,4867,Ross,752,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,105,"No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!"
4868,4868,Rachel,675,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,106,"Please. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,"" what would you say?"
4869,4869,Chandler,662,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,107,"If it helps, I could slide over."
4870,4870,Ross,753,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,108,"It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go."
4871,4871,Phoebe,535,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,109,Where are you going?
4872,4872,Ross,754,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,110,"(leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?"
4873,4873,Chandler,663,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,111,Hello? Hello?
4874,4874,Rachel,676,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,112,"(on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God."
4875,4875,Chandler,664,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,113,So how's Mindy?
4876,4876,Rachel,677,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,114,"Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!"
4878,4878,Monica,682,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,116,Brrrrrrr!
4879,4879,Chandler,665,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,117,Hell is filled with people like you.
4880,4880,Joey,489,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,118,(entering) He's back! The peeper's back!
4881,4881,Joey,490,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,119,(ducking) Get down!
4882,4882,Rachel,678,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,120,Get down?
4883,4883,Chandler,666,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,121,...And boogie!
4884,4884,Rachel,679,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,122,"Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy."
4885,4885,Monica,683,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,123,"Relax. Y'know, she may not even know."
4886,4886,Rachel,680,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,124,"Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss.."
4887,4887,Joey,491,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,125,(intrigued) Yeah?
4888,4888,Rachel,681,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,126,"And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.."
4889,4889,Joey,492,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,127,..Naughty!
4890,4890,Rachel,682,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,128,"Right, I'll see you guys later..."
4891,4891,Joey,493,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,129,"Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah..."
4892,4892,Chandler,667,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,130,"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?"
4893,4893,Monica,684,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,131,Why don't you just take it with you?
4894,4894,Chandler,668,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,132,"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
4895,4895,Monica,685,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,133,Why don't you just call her?
4896,4896,Chandler,669,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,134,"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
4897,4897,Monica,686,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,135,Do you?
4898,4898,Chandler,670,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,136,"No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."
4899,4899,Monica,687,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,137,Don't you have to pee?
4900,4900,Chandler,671,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,138,'S'why I'm dancing...
4901,4901,Rachel,683,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,139,Mindy.
4903,4903,Rachel,684,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,141,"Hey, you.... So, what's up?"
4905,4905,Rachel,685,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,143,Sure we should... So.
4907,4907,Rachel,686,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,145,Okay.
4909,4909,Rachel,687,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,147,Of course!
4911,4911,Rachel,688,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,149,Was that all you wanted to ask me?
4913,4913,Rachel,689,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,151,Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
4915,4915,Rachel,690,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,153,Oh sure it is!
4917,4917,Rachel,691,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,155,"Um, what- what would make you think that?"
4919,4919,Rachel,692,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,157,"(draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too."
4921,4921,Rachel,693,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,159,What? What's what you were afraid of?
4923,4923,Rachel,694,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,161,What?
4925,4925,Rachel,695,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,163,"Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid."
4927,4927,Rachel,696,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,165,(offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?
4929,4929,Rachel,697,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,167,"Oh, I am so sorry."
4931,4931,Joey,494,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,169,(watches them for a while) Oh my.

4936,4936,Chandler,673,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,174,What?!
4937,4937,Joey,496,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,175,"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
4938,4938,Chandler,674,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,176,"(investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
4939,4939,Monica,688,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,177,Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just pointing out the irony.
4940,4940,Joey,497,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,178,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"

4965,4965,Rachel,701,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,203,Even when we were having sex in that chair?
4967,4967,Rachel,702,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,205,Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
4969,4969,Rachel,703,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,207,"Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry."
4974,4974,Rachel,704,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,212,"Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great."
4976,4976,Rachel,705,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,214,"What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!"
4978,4978,Rachel,706,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,216,Oh God.
4980,4980,Rachel,707,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,218,And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
4981,4981,Monica,693,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,219,You okay?
4982,4982,Rachel,708,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,220,Yeah.
4983,4983,Monica,694,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,221,Really?
4984,4984,Rachel,709,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,222,"Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know."
4985,4985,Monica,695,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,223,Aww... (They hug)
4986,4986,Joey,503,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,224,Big day.
4988,4988,Joey,504,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,226,"All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
4989,4989,Phoebe,538,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,227,You know he's gay?
4990,4990,Ross,759,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,228,I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
4992,4992,Chandler,676,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,230,"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
4994,4994,Chandler,677,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,232,What are you doing here?
4996,4996,Chandler,678,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,234,"...I'm, I'm okay."
4998,4998,Chandler,679,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,236,"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
5000,5000,Chandler,680,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,238,Okay.
5003,5003,Phoebe,539,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,241,Whoo-hoo!
5004,5004,Monica,696,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,242,"Yeah, there you go!"
5005,5005,Ross,760,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,243,Second date!
5006,5006,Chandler,681,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,244,...I dunno.
5007,5007,Rachel,710,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,245,You don't know?!
5008,5008,Chandler,682,1,20,The Evil Orthodontist,246,"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?"
5009,5009,Joey,505,1,21,The Fake Monica,0,How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
5010,5010,Monica,697,1,21,The Fake Monica,1,I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
5011,5011,Rachel,711,1,21,The Fake Monica,2,"Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought."
5012,5012,Monica,698,1,21,The Fake Monica,3,I know. It's just such reckless spending.
5013,5013,Ross,761,1,21,The Fake Monica,4,"I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind."
5014,5014,Chandler,683,1,21,The Fake Monica,5,"Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop."
5015,5015,Monica,699,1,21,The Fake Monica,6,That's me.
5016,5016,Phoebe,540,1,21,The Fake Monica,7,"Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)"
5017,5017,Ross,762,1,21,The Fake Monica,8,"Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-"
5018,5018,Rachel,712,1,21,The Fake Monica,9,"Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him."
5019,5019,Monica,700,1,21,The Fake Monica,10,"Ross, you've got to do something about the humping."
5020,5020,Ross,763,1,21,The Fake Monica,11,"What? It's, it's just a phase."
5021,5021,Chandler,684,1,21,The Fake Monica,12,"Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
5022,5022,Ross,764,1,21,The Fake Monica,13,Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
5023,5023,Rachel,713,1,21,The Fake Monica,14,(Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
5024,5024,Ross,765,1,21,The Fake Monica,15,What?
5025,5025,Rachel,714,1,21,The Fake Monica,16,Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
5027,5027,Rachel,715,1,21,The Fake Monica,18,"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing."
5028,5028,Monica,701,1,21,The Fake Monica,19,This woman's living my life.
5029,5029,Rachel,716,1,21,The Fake Monica,20,What?
5030,5030,Monica,702,1,21,The Fake Monica,21,"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies."
5031,5031,Rachel,717,1,21,The Fake Monica,22,You're not an artist.
5032,5032,Monica,703,1,21,The Fake Monica,23,"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't."
5033,5033,Rachel,718,1,21,The Fake Monica,24,"Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things."
5034,5034,Monica,704,1,21,The Fake Monica,25,"Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we."
5035,5035,Rachel,719,1,21,The Fake Monica,26,"(Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."
5036,5036,Monica,705,1,21,The Fake Monica,27,Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
5037,5037,Rachel,720,1,21,The Fake Monica,28,(Yawning) Nooo...
5038,5038,Monica,706,1,21,The Fake Monica,29,"This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother."
5039,5039,Chandler,685,1,21,The Fake Monica,30,How about Joey... Pepponi?
5040,5040,Joey,506,1,21,The Fake Monica,31,"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral."
5041,5041,Chandler,686,1,21,The Fake Monica,32,Joey... Switzerland?
5042,5042,Joey,507,1,21,The Fake Monica,33,"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not."
5043,5043,Chandler,687,1,21,The Fake Monica,34,Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
5044,5044,Joey,508,1,21,The Fake Monica,35,Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
5045,5045,Chandler,688,1,21,The Fake Monica,36,"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
5046,5046,Joey,509,1,21,The Fake Monica,37,"(Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
5047,5047,Chandler,689,1,21,The Fake Monica,38,Might wanna try Joseph.
5048,5048,Joey,510,1,21,The Fake Monica,39,Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
5049,5049,Chandler,690,1,21,The Fake Monica,40,"Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof."
5050,5050,Rachel,721,1,21,The Fake Monica,41,Hey.
5051,5051,Phoebe,541,1,21,The Fake Monica,42,Hey.
5052,5052,Monica,707,1,21,The Fake Monica,43,"Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were."
5053,5053,Phoebe,542,1,21,The Fake Monica,44,What are you doing?
5054,5054,Monica,708,1,21,The Fake Monica,45,"(Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap class."
5055,5055,Rachel,722,1,21,The Fake Monica,46,"What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?"
5056,5056,Monica,709,1,21,The Fake Monica,47,"This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is."
5057,5057,Rachel,723,1,21,The Fake Monica,48,"Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing."
5058,5058,Phoebe,543,1,21,The Fake Monica,49,"This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you."
5059,5059,Monica,710,1,21,The Fake Monica,50,What d'you think?
5060,5060,Phoebe,544,1,21,The Fake Monica,51,Lotsa things.
5061,5061,Rachel,724,1,21,The Fake Monica,52,Which one do you think she is?
5063,5063,Monica,711,1,21,The Fake Monica,54,"Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe."
5065,5065,Rachel,725,1,21,The Fake Monica,56,What does she mean?
5066,5066,Phoebe,545,1,21,The Fake Monica,57,I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance
5067,5067,Monica,712,1,21,The Fake Monica,58,"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?"
5069,5069,Rachel,726,1,21,The Fake Monica,60,She could be you.
5071,5071,Monica,713,1,21,The Fake Monica,62,"Okay, I'm not getting this!"
5072,5072,Phoebe,546,1,21,The Fake Monica,63,"(Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!"
5073,5073,Monica,714,1,21,The Fake Monica,64,Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
5074,5074,Rachel,727,1,21,The Fake Monica,65,What? You just click when they click.
5076,5076,Phoebe,547,1,21,The Fake Monica,67,"Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel."
5077,5077,Monica,715,1,21,The Fake Monica,68,Great. It's gym class all over again.
5080,5080,Monica,716,1,21,The Fake Monica,71,Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
5084,5084,Monica,717,1,21,The Fake Monica,75,Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
5086,5086,Monica,718,1,21,The Fake Monica,77,Yeah. It's Dutch.
5088,5088,Monica,719,1,21,The Fake Monica,79,"Um, Pennsylvania Dutch."
5090,5090,Ross,766,1,21,The Fake Monica,81,(Mortified) Hi.
5092,5092,Joey,511,1,21,The Fake Monica,83,Where've you been?
5093,5093,Ross,767,1,21,The Fake Monica,84,At the vet.
5094,5094,Chandler,691,1,21,The Fake Monica,85,"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
5095,5095,Ross,768,1,21,The Fake Monica,86,She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
5096,5096,Joey,512,1,21,The Fake Monica,87,(To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.
5097,5097,Ross,769,1,21,The Fake Monica,88,"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
5098,5098,Chandler,692,1,21,The Fake Monica,89,So what does this mean?
5099,5099,Ross,770,1,21,The Fake Monica,90,I'm gonna have to give him up.
5101,5101,Joey,513,1,21,The Fake Monica,92,"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"
5102,5102,Chandler,693,1,21,The Fake Monica,93,"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?"
5103,5103,Ross,771,1,21,The Fake Monica,94,"I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg."
5104,5104,Joey,514,1,21,The Fake Monica,95,Isn't there any way you can keep him?
5105,5105,Ross,772,1,21,The Fake Monica,96,"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo."
5106,5106,Joey,515,1,21,The Fake Monica,97,How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
5107,5107,Chandler,694,1,21,The Fake Monica,98,"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen."
5108,5108,Ross,773,1,21,The Fake Monica,99,"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility."
5109,5109,Chandler,695,1,21,The Fake Monica,100,"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo."
5110,5110,Phoebe,548,1,21,The Fake Monica,101,"Hey. We found her, we found the girl."
5111,5111,Chandler,696,1,21,The Fake Monica,102,What?
5112,5112,Joey,516,1,21,The Fake Monica,103,Did you call the cops?
5113,5113,Rachel,728,1,21,The Fake Monica,104,Nope. We took her to lunch.
5114,5114,Chandler,697,1,21,The Fake Monica,105,Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
5115,5115,Ross,774,1,21,The Fake Monica,106,What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
5116,5116,Monica,720,1,21,The Fake Monica,107,"Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit."
5117,5117,Ross,775,1,21,The Fake Monica,108,"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader."
5118,5118,Chandler,698,1,21,The Fake Monica,109,...Take off their hats!
5119,5119,Phoebe,549,1,21,The Fake Monica,110,Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
5120,5120,Rachel,729,1,21,The Fake Monica,111,No way. No way did you do this.
5122,5122,Monica,721,1,21,The Fake Monica,113,It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
5124,5124,Monica,722,1,21,The Fake Monica,115,...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
5125,5125,Rachel,730,1,21,The Fake Monica,116,"Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)"
5127,5127,Monica,723,1,21,The Fake Monica,118,'Scuse me?
5129,5129,Monica,724,1,21,The Fake Monica,120,"Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class."
5131,5131,Monica,725,1,21,The Fake Monica,122,What?
5133,5133,Monica,726,1,21,The Fake Monica,124,"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned."
5135,5135,Monica,727,1,21,The Fake Monica,126,Uh-huh.
5137,5137,Monica,728,1,21,The Fake Monica,128,Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
5138,5138,Ross,776,1,21,The Fake Monica,129,"(Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him."
5139,5139,Phoebe,550,1,21,The Fake Monica,130,I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
5140,5140,Ross,777,1,21,The Fake Monica,131,"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?"
5141,5141,Rachel,731,1,21,The Fake Monica,132,"Oh, somebody will."
5142,5142,Joey,517,1,21,The Fake Monica,133,(entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
5143,5143,Chandler,699,1,21,The Fake Monica,134,You're kidding.
5144,5144,Joey,518,1,21,The Fake Monica,135,Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
5145,5145,Chandler,700,1,21,The Fake Monica,136,"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
5146,5146,Joey,519,1,21,The Fake Monica,137,Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
5147,5147,Phoebe,551,1,21,The Fake Monica,138,...Flame Boy.
5148,5148,Ross,778,1,21,The Fake Monica,139,Where exactly is your zoo?
5150,5150,Ross,779,1,21,The Fake Monica,141,Yes.
5152,5152,Ross,780,1,21,The Fake Monica,143,"No-no, he's, he's very docile."
5154,5154,Ross,781,1,21,The Fake Monica,145,"Well I, I don't know. Why?"
5156,5156,Ross,782,1,21,The Fake Monica,147,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
5158,5158,Ross,783,1,21,The Fake Monica,149,Why- why- why would he need a blade?
5161,5161,Joey,520,1,21,The Fake Monica,152,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..."
5162,5162,Chandler,701,1,21,The Fake Monica,153,...He's in.
5163,5163,Ross,784,1,21,The Fake Monica,154,"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"
5165,5165,Monica,729,1,21,The Fake Monica,156,Yo- hooo!
5166,5166,Rachel,732,1,21,The Fake Monica,157,Where the hell've you been?
5167,5167,Monica,730,1,21,The Fake Monica,158,Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
5168,5168,Rachel,733,1,21,The Fake Monica,159,Are you drunk?!
5169,5169,Monica,731,1,21,The Fake Monica,160,Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
5170,5170,Rachel,734,1,21,The Fake Monica,161,"Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried..."
5171,5171,Rachel,735,1,21,The Fake Monica,162,Monica? Monica!
5172,5172,Monica,732,1,21,The Fake Monica,163,Water rules!
5173,5173,Rachel,736,1,21,The Fake Monica,164,"Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?"
5174,5174,Monica,733,1,21,The Fake Monica,165,Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
5175,5175,Rachel,737,1,21,The Fake Monica,166,"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!"
5176,5176,Monica,734,1,21,The Fake Monica,167,"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!"
5177,5177,Rachel,738,1,21,The Fake Monica,168,"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people."
5178,5178,Monica,735,1,21,The Fake Monica,169,Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
5179,5179,Rachel,739,1,21,The Fake Monica,170,What?
5180,5180,Monica,736,1,21,The Fake Monica,171,They've arrested Monica.
5181,5181,Monica,737,1,21,The Fake Monica,172,Hi.
5183,5183,Monica,738,1,21,The Fake Monica,174,How are you?
5185,5185,Monica,739,1,21,The Fake Monica,176,Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
5187,5187,Monica,740,1,21,The Fake Monica,178,"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
5189,5189,Monica,741,1,21,The Fake Monica,180,"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!"
5191,5191,Monica,742,1,21,The Fake Monica,182,"I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?"
5193,5193,Monica,743,1,21,The Fake Monica,184,"Well, not... worried, just... wondering."
5195,5195,Monica,744,1,21,The Fake Monica,186,Not necessarily...
5197,5197,Monica,745,1,21,The Fake Monica,188,"Um, I'm not actually Amish."
5200,5200,Monica,746,1,21,The Fake Monica,191,In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)
5202,5202,Monica,747,1,21,The Fake Monica,193,"Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!"
5204,5204,Phoebe,552,1,21,The Fake Monica,195,"Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane."
5205,5205,Ross,785,1,21,The Fake Monica,196,"Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe."
5206,5206,Phoebe,553,1,21,The Fake Monica,197,Oh!
5207,5207,Chandler,702,1,21,The Fake Monica,198,"Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."
5208,5208,Joey,521,1,21,The Fake Monica,199,"I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey."
5209,5209,Ross,786,1,21,The Fake Monica,200,"Just, just say what you feel."
5210,5210,Joey,522,1,21,The Fake Monica,201,"Marcel, I'm hungry."
5211,5211,Ross,787,1,21,The Fake Monica,202,That was good.
5212,5212,Rachel,740,1,21,The Fake Monica,203,"(Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane."
5213,5213,Ross,788,1,21,The Fake Monica,204,"Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him."
5215,5215,Ross,789,1,21,The Fake Monica,206,"Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him."
5220,5220,Joey,523,1,21,The Fake Monica,211,"Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."
5222,5222,Joey,524,1,21,The Fake Monica,213,Holden McGroin.
5223,5223,Monica,748,1,22,The Ick Factor,0,Tell him.
5224,5224,Rachel,741,1,22,The Ick Factor,1,No.
5225,5225,Phoebe,554,1,22,The Ick Factor,2,"Tell him, tell him."
5226,5226,Monica,749,1,22,The Ick Factor,3,Just...please tell him.
5227,5227,Rachel,742,1,22,The Ick Factor,4,Shut up!
5228,5228,Chandler,703,1,22,The Ick Factor,5,Tell me what?
5229,5229,Monica,750,1,22,The Ick Factor,6,"Look at you, you won't even look at him."
5230,5230,Chandler,704,1,22,The Ick Factor,7,"(sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me."
5231,5231,Rachel,743,1,22,The Ick Factor,8,"All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were..."
5232,5232,Phoebe,555,1,22,The Ick Factor,9,Doing it on this table. (points at the table)
5233,5233,Chandler,705,1,22,The Ick Factor,10,Wow!
5234,5234,Joey,525,1,22,The Ick Factor,11,Exellent dream score.
5235,5235,Ross,790,1,22,The Ick Factor,12,"Why, why, why would you dream that?"
5236,5236,Chandler,706,1,22,The Ick Factor,13,"More importantly, was I any good?"
5237,5237,Rachel,744,1,22,The Ick Factor,14,"Well, you were pretty damn good."
5238,5238,Chandler,707,1,22,The Ick Factor,15,"Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)"
5239,5239,Rachel,745,1,22,The Ick Factor,16,"Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table."
5240,5240,Ross,791,1,22,The Ick Factor,17,"I love it, when we share."
5241,5241,Chandler,708,1,22,The Ick Factor,18,You're okay there?
5242,5242,Ross,792,1,22,The Ick Factor,19,I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
5243,5243,Chandler,709,1,22,The Ick Factor,20,"I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious."
5245,5245,Chandler,710,1,22,The Ick Factor,22,Hello Rachel.
5246,5246,Rachel,746,1,22,The Ick Factor,23,Get off.
5247,5247,Phoebe,556,1,22,The Ick Factor,24,"(points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?"
5248,5248,Joey,526,1,22,The Ick Factor,25,I don't know. What are you wearing?
5249,5249,Ross,793,1,22,The Ick Factor,26,"Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?"
5250,5250,Phoebe,557,1,22,The Ick Factor,27,"Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients."
5251,5251,Chandler,711,1,22,The Ick Factor,28,Pirates again?
5252,5252,Phoebe,558,1,22,The Ick Factor,29,"No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this ""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop."" And they are."
5253,5253,Joey,527,1,22,The Ick Factor,30,"Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you."
5254,5254,Chandler,712,1,22,The Ick Factor,31,"(sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea."
5255,5255,Phoebe,559,1,22,The Ick Factor,32,"What... I could, I could do it. What is it?"
5256,5256,Chandler,713,1,22,The Ick Factor,33,"Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story."
5257,5257,Phoebe,560,1,22,The Ick Factor,34,I could be a secretary.
5258,5258,Chandler,714,1,22,The Ick Factor,35,"Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day."
5259,5259,Phoebe,561,1,22,The Ick Factor,36,I could do that.
5260,5260,Rachel,747,1,22,The Ick Factor,37,What are you playing with?
5261,5261,Ross,794,1,22,The Ick Factor,38,"Oh, it's my new beeper."
5262,5262,Joey,528,1,22,The Ick Factor,39,What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
5263,5263,Monica,751,1,22,The Ick Factor,40,"Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'"
5264,5264,Ross,795,1,22,The Ick Factor,41,"No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO."
5265,5265,Chandler,715,1,22,The Ick Factor,42,"A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid."
5266,5266,Monica,752,1,22,The Ick Factor,43,"All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)"
5267,5267,Rachel,748,1,22,The Ick Factor,44,Off to see young Ethan?
5268,5268,Monica,753,1,22,The Ick Factor,45,Thank you.
5269,5269,Joey,529,1,22,The Ick Factor,46,How young is young Ethan? Young?
5270,5270,Monica,754,1,22,The Ick Factor,47,He's... our age.
5271,5271,Chandler,716,1,22,The Ick Factor,48,When we were?
5272,5272,Monica,755,1,22,The Ick Factor,49,"Okay, he's a senior in college."
5273,5273,Ross,796,1,22,The Ick Factor,50,College?
5274,5274,Chandler,717,1,22,The Ick Factor,51,Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
5275,5275,Monica,756,1,22,The Ick Factor,52,"No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22."
5277,5277,Monica,757,1,22,The Ick Factor,54,"Oh, I can't pass for 22?"
5278,5278,Phoebe,562,1,22,The Ick Factor,55,"Well, maybe 25-26."
5279,5279,Monica,758,1,22,The Ick Factor,56,I am 26.
5280,5280,Phoebe,563,1,22,The Ick Factor,57,There you go.
5281,5281,Chandler,718,1,22,The Ick Factor,58,Can you hear that?
5282,5282,Phoebe,564,1,22,The Ick Factor,59,(plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?
5283,5283,Chandler,719,1,22,The Ick Factor,60,See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
5284,5284,Phoebe,565,1,22,The Ick Factor,61,"Oh. Uh, I'm on. (picks up the phone)"
5285,5285,Phoebe,566,1,22,The Ick Factor,62,"(with a deep voice) Mr. Bing's office. (Listens) No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now."
5286,5286,Chandler,720,1,22,The Ick Factor,63,I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
5287,5287,Phoebe,567,1,22,The Ick Factor,64,"Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he has your number? (Listens) All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye."
5288,5288,Chandler,721,1,22,The Ick Factor,65,What?
5289,5289,Phoebe,568,1,22,The Ick Factor,66,Ross says hi.
5290,5290,Chandler,722,1,22,The Ick Factor,67,Ah!
5291,5291,Phoebe,569,1,22,The Ick Factor,68,"This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?"
5292,5292,Chandler,723,1,22,The Ick Factor,69,"Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
5293,5293,Phoebe,570,1,22,The Ick Factor,70,"Most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) Okay, I'm gonna be out there."
5294,5294,Chandler,724,1,22,The Ick Factor,71,Okay.
5295,5295,Phoebe,571,1,22,The Ick Factor,72,All right. Bye bye.
5296,5296,Chandler,725,1,22,The Ick Factor,73,Bye bye.
5297,5297,Chandler,726,1,22,The Ick Factor,74,(answering it) Yes?
5298,5298,Phoebe,572,1,22,The Ick Factor,75,Whatcha doin'?
5299,5299,Chandler,727,1,22,The Ick Factor,76,Ooh. (leans against the desk)
5300,5300,Monica,759,1,22,The Ick Factor,77,"Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?"
5301,5301,Rachel,749,1,22,The Ick Factor,78,"Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
5302,5302,Monica,760,1,22,The Ick Factor,79,What?
5303,5303,Rachel,750,1,22,The Ick Factor,80,Could tonight be the Night?
5304,5304,Monica,761,1,22,The Ick Factor,81,"I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things."
5305,5305,Rachel,751,1,22,The Ick Factor,82,"So, did you shave your legs?"
5306,5306,Monica,762,1,22,The Ick Factor,83,Yeah.
5307,5307,Rachel,752,1,22,The Ick Factor,84,A-ha!
5308,5308,Joey,530,1,22,The Ick Factor,85,Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
5309,5309,Ross,797,1,22,The Ick Factor,86,"Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time."
5310,5310,Joey,531,1,22,The Ick Factor,87,"All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool."
5311,5311,Ross,798,1,22,The Ick Factor,88,"(on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, Andr� is not here. (to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services."
5312,5312,Joey,532,1,22,The Ick Factor,89,"Services? (Ross looks at him) Oh, services."
5313,5313,Ross,799,1,22,The Ick Factor,90,"(on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye."
5314,5314,Joey,533,1,22,The Ick Factor,91,"Hey, hey. How was the first day?"
5315,5315,Phoebe,573,1,22,The Ick Factor,92,"Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice."
5316,5316,Chandler,728,1,22,The Ick Factor,93,"See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder what he means) Me."
5317,5317,Phoebe,574,1,22,The Ick Factor,94,"No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you."
5318,5318,Chandler,729,1,22,The Ick Factor,95,Why not?
5319,5319,Phoebe,575,1,22,The Ick Factor,96,"Oh, because, you know... they don't like you."
5320,5320,Chandler,730,1,22,The Ick Factor,97,What?!
5321,5321,Phoebe,576,1,22,The Ick Factor,98,I thought you knew that.
5322,5322,Chandler,731,1,22,The Ick Factor,99,Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
5323,5323,Phoebe,577,1,22,The Ick Factor,100,Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
5324,5324,Chandler,732,1,22,The Ick Factor,101,What are you talking about?
5325,5325,Phoebe,578,1,22,The Ick Factor,102,"Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like ""Mr. Boss Man"". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, ""Boss Man Bing""."
5326,5326,Chandler,733,1,22,The Ick Factor,103,I can't belive it.
5327,5327,Phoebe,579,1,22,The Ick Factor,104,"Yeah, yeah. They even do you."
5328,5328,Chandler,734,1,22,The Ick Factor,105,They do me?
5329,5329,Phoebe,580,1,22,The Ick Factor,106,You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
5330,5330,Chandler,735,1,22,The Ick Factor,107,I don't sound like that.
5331,5331,Ross,800,1,22,The Ick Factor,108,"Oh, oh Chandler..."
5332,5332,Joey,534,1,22,The Ick Factor,109,"Oh... Yeah, you do."
5333,5333,Ross,801,1,22,The Ick Factor,110,'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
5334,5334,Joey,535,1,22,The Ick Factor,111,(reaches for hi scones) My scones.
5336,5336,Chandler,736,1,22,The Ick Factor,113,"Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true."
5337,5337,Chandler,737,1,22,The Ick Factor,114,"That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!"
5338,5338,Monica,763,1,22,The Ick Factor,115,Did not.
5340,5340,Monica,764,1,22,The Ick Factor,117,How was that possible?
5342,5342,Monica,765,1,22,The Ick Factor,119,Okay.
5344,5344,Monica,766,1,22,The Ick Factor,121,Unless...
5346,5346,Monica,767,1,22,The Ick Factor,123,"Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so..."
5349,5349,Monica,768,1,22,The Ick Factor,126,"Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'"
5351,5351,Monica,769,1,22,The Ick Factor,128,Ethan?
5353,5353,Monica,770,1,22,The Ick Factor,130,Are you a virgin?
5355,5355,Monica,771,1,22,The Ick Factor,132,Really?
5358,5358,Monica,772,1,22,The Ick Factor,135,You keep saying that.
5360,5360,Monica,773,1,22,The Ick Factor,137,"Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to."
5362,5362,Monica,774,1,22,The Ick Factor,139,No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
5364,5364,Monica,775,1,22,The Ick Factor,141,"Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months."
5366,5366,Monica,776,1,22,The Ick Factor,143,"But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are."
5368,5368,Monica,777,1,22,The Ick Factor,145,You're not a senior?
5370,5370,Monica,778,1,22,The Ick Factor,147,Ok...ay.
5372,5372,Monica,779,1,22,The Ick Factor,149,"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial."
5374,5374,Monica,780,1,22,The Ick Factor,151,"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
5376,5376,Monica,781,1,22,The Ick Factor,153,"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?"
5378,5378,Monica,782,1,22,The Ick Factor,155,Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)
5380,5380,Monica,783,1,22,The Ick Factor,157,Really?
5382,5382,Monica,784,1,22,The Ick Factor,159,"Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins."
5384,5384,Ross,802,1,22,The Ick Factor,161,"(on phone) Okay, Andr� should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way."
5385,5385,Chandler,738,1,22,The Ick Factor,162,"Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream."
5386,5386,Rachel,753,1,22,The Ick Factor,163,"No, forget it."
5387,5387,Chandler,739,1,22,The Ick Factor,164,"Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?"
5388,5388,Rachel,754,1,22,The Ick Factor,165,"All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to Ross, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too."
5389,5389,Joey,536,1,22,The Ick Factor,166,All right. (Moves closer.)
5390,5390,Ross,803,1,22,The Ick Factor,167,"Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there."
5391,5391,Rachel,755,1,22,The Ick Factor,168,No.
5392,5392,Ross,804,1,22,The Ick Factor,169,"You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?"
5393,5393,Rachel,756,1,22,The Ick Factor,170,"No, it was just the three of us."
5394,5394,Ross,805,1,22,The Ick Factor,171,Huh!
5395,5395,Joey,537,1,22,The Ick Factor,172,"So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?"
5396,5396,Rachel,757,1,22,The Ick Factor,173,(laughs) You know what?
5397,5397,Joey,538,1,22,The Ick Factor,174,What?
5398,5398,Rachel,758,1,22,The Ick Factor,175,There were times when it wasn't even me.
5399,5399,Phoebe,581,1,22,The Ick Factor,176,"That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)"
5401,5401,Rachel,759,1,22,The Ick Factor,178,"Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?"
5403,5403,Monica,785,1,22,The Ick Factor,180,What?
5404,5404,Rachel,760,1,22,The Ick Factor,181,Ethan called again.
5405,5405,Monica,786,1,22,The Ick Factor,182,Oh.
5406,5406,Ross,806,1,22,The Ick Factor,183,Are you not seeing him anymore?
5407,5407,Monica,787,1,22,The Ick Factor,184,"No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out."
5408,5408,Chandler,740,1,22,The Ick Factor,185,And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
5409,5409,Rachel,761,1,22,The Ick Factor,186,"I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by."
5410,5410,Joey,539,1,22,The Ick Factor,187,"Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?"
5411,5411,Ross,807,1,22,The Ick Factor,188,"Oh, yeah."
5412,5412,Monica,788,1,22,The Ick Factor,189,"Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?"
5414,5414,Ross,808,1,22,The Ick Factor,191,It's morphin time!
5415,5415,Joey,540,1,22,The Ick Factor,192,Stegosaurus!
5416,5416,Chandler,741,1,22,The Ick Factor,193,Tyrannosaurus!
5417,5417,Phoebe,582,1,22,The Ick Factor,194,"Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!"
5418,5418,Rachel,762,1,22,The Ick Factor,195,Where are you going?
5419,5419,Phoebe,583,1,22,The Ick Factor,196,"Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people."
5420,5420,Chandler,742,1,22,The Ick Factor,197,Work people? Nobody told me.
5421,5421,Phoebe,584,1,22,The Ick Factor,198,"No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza."
5422,5422,Chandler,743,1,22,The Ick Factor,199,"You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person."
5423,5423,Phoebe,585,1,22,The Ick Factor,200,"Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are."
5424,5424,Chandler,744,1,22,The Ick Factor,201,You think I should?
5425,5425,Phoebe,586,1,22,The Ick Factor,202,"I really do, yeah."
5426,5426,Chandler,745,1,22,The Ick Factor,203,Okay.
5427,5427,Phoebe,587,1,22,The Ick Factor,204,Okay.
5428,5428,Chandler,746,1,22,The Ick Factor,205,Okay.
5429,5429,Phoebe,588,1,22,The Ick Factor,206,"Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss."
5430,5430,Chandler,747,1,22,The Ick Factor,207,"I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory."
5431,5431,Phoebe,589,1,22,The Ick Factor,208,You were great. But they still made fun of you.
5432,5432,Chandler,748,1,22,The Ick Factor,209,What?
5433,5433,Phoebe,590,1,22,The Ick Factor,210,"You know, now you're more like, you know like, ""Mr. Caring Boss,"" ""Mr."", you know, ""I'm one of you, Boss,"" ""Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"""
5434,5434,Chandler,749,1,22,The Ick Factor,211,"Then, I don't get it."
5435,5435,Phoebe,591,1,22,The Ick Factor,212,"Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss."
5436,5436,Chandler,750,1,22,The Ick Factor,213,They do?
5437,5437,Phoebe,592,1,22,The Ick Factor,214,Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
5438,5438,Chandler,751,1,22,The Ick Factor,215,I just wan't to...
5439,5439,Phoebe,593,1,22,The Ick Factor,216,"No, but you can't."
5440,5440,Chandler,752,1,22,The Ick Factor,217,But I just wa...
5441,5441,Phoebe,594,1,22,The Ick Factor,218,Uh uh.
5442,5442,Monica,789,1,22,The Ick Factor,219,Aren't you gonna...
5443,5443,Ross,809,1,22,The Ick Factor,220,"Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it."
5444,5444,Joey,541,1,22,The Ick Factor,221,What about Andr�?
5445,5445,Ross,810,1,22,The Ick Factor,222,"Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know."
5447,5447,Monica,790,1,22,The Ick Factor,224,That was gonna be my opener.
5448,5448,Rachel,763,1,22,The Ick Factor,225,"(understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?"
5449,5449,Ross,811,1,22,The Ick Factor,226,I thought that was just a rumour.
5450,5450,Rachel,764,1,22,The Ick Factor,227,True story.
5451,5451,Joey,542,1,22,The Ick Factor,228,They're here already?
5453,5453,Monica,791,1,22,The Ick Factor,230,It was.
5455,5455,Monica,792,1,22,The Ick Factor,232,"Ethan, it's um... it's icky."
5457,5457,Monica,793,1,22,The Ick Factor,234,"This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really..."
5459,5459,Monica,794,1,22,The Ick Factor,236,...love you.
5460,5460,Ross,812,1,22,The Ick Factor,237,Are you're hands still wet?
5461,5461,Joey,543,1,22,The Ick Factor,238,"Uh, moist, yeah."
5462,5462,Rachel,765,1,22,The Ick Factor,239,Let's dry 'em again.
5466,5466,Chandler,753,1,22,The Ick Factor,243,"Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock."
5469,5469,Chandler,754,1,22,The Ick Factor,246,"You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?"
5470,5470,Phoebe,595,1,22,The Ick Factor,247,Petrie.
5471,5471,Chandler,755,1,22,The Ick Factor,248,"Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend."
5472,5472,Rachel,766,1,22,The Ick Factor,249,"(talking in her sleep) Oooooooooh. (Rachel strokes her hand over the pillow. Ross mimicks her silently) Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!"
5473,5473,Rachel,767,1,22,The Ick Factor,250,Ross?
5474,5474,Ross,813,1,22,The Ick Factor,251,I'm here.
5475,5475,Rachel,768,1,22,The Ick Factor,252,"You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...  Wow!"
5476,5476,Ross,814,1,22,The Ick Factor,253,"What? (his beeper goes off) Great, now I'm having a baby."
5477,5477,Rachel,769,1,22,The Ick Factor,254,What?
5478,5478,Ross,815,1,22,The Ick Factor,255,"Ooh, Ooh."
5479,5479,Rachel,770,1,22,The Ick Factor,256,What?
5480,5480,Ross,816,1,22,The Ick Factor,257,I'm having... I'm having a baby. (jumps back onto the table again) I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
5481,5481,Rachel,771,1,22,The Ick Factor,258,I don't know where the phone is.
5482,5482,Rachel,772,1,22,The Ick Factor,259,Ross?
5483,5483,Ross,817,1,22,The Ick Factor,260,I'm hurt.
5485,5485,Ross,818,1,22,The Ick Factor,262,"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor."
5486,5486,Chandler,756,1,22,The Ick Factor,263,"(doing a little dance) Hey Ross, look what I've got going here."
5487,5487,Ross,819,1,22,The Ick Factor,264,"Yeah, save it for the cab, okay."
5488,5488,Ross,820,1,22,The Ick Factor,265,What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
5489,5489,Rachel,773,1,22,The Ick Factor,266,"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there."
5490,5490,Ross,821,1,22,The Ick Factor,267,"Joey, get out of the fridge."
5491,5491,Joey,544,1,22,The Ick Factor,268,"All right, all right. (he comes out from their apartment with a huge sandwich in his hand)"
5492,5492,Ross,822,1,22,The Ick Factor,269,What is that? (refering to the sandwich)
5493,5493,Joey,545,1,22,The Ick Factor,270,For the ride.
5494,5494,Chandler,757,1,22,The Ick Factor,271,"Yeah, like in a cab..."
5495,5495,Ross,823,1,22,The Ick Factor,272,Save it.
5496,5496,Chandler,758,1,22,The Ick Factor,273,"Okay, hating this."
5497,5497,Ross,824,1,22,The Ick Factor,274,"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming."
5498,5498,Monica,795,1,22,The Ick Factor,275,"I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew."
5499,5499,Ross,825,1,22,The Ick Factor,276,"That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on."
5500,5500,Joey,546,1,22,The Ick Factor,277,"All right, I'm going. I'm going."
5501,5501,Chandler,759,1,22,The Ick Factor,278,"Here we go, here we go."
5502,5502,Rachel,774,1,22,The Ick Factor,279,"Rossy, Rossy."
5504,5504,Ross,826,1,23,The Birth,1,She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
5505,5505,Monica,796,1,23,The Birth,2,I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
5506,5506,Ross,827,1,23,The Birth,3,"I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug."
5507,5507,Joey,547,1,23,The Birth,4,Do we have to know about that?
5508,5508,Monica,797,1,23,The Birth,5,"Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?"
5509,5509,Joey,548,1,23,The Birth,6,"I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
5510,5510,Chandler,760,1,23,The Birth,7,"Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's."
5511,5511,Ross,828,1,23,The Birth,8,"God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab."
5512,5512,Rachel,775,1,23,The Birth,9,"Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction."
5513,5513,Rachel,776,1,23,The Birth,10,"What, it's ok when Chandler does it?"
5514,5514,Chandler,761,1,23,The Birth,11,You have to pick your moments.
5515,5515,Phoebe,596,1,23,The Birth,12,"Did I miss it, did I miss it?"
5516,5516,Ross,829,1,23,The Birth,13,She's not even here yet.
5517,5517,Monica,798,1,23,The Birth,14,What's with the guitar?
5518,5518,Phoebe,597,1,23,The Birth,15,"I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical."
5519,5519,Ross,830,1,23,The Birth,16,(to Carol) Where the hell have you been?
5522,5522,Ross,831,1,23,The Birth,19,"Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys."
5523,5523,Chandler,762,1,23,The Birth,20,I used to have that bumper sticker.
5524,5524,Chandler,763,1,23,The Birth,21,(to Rachel) You see what I mean.
5526,5526,Ross,832,1,23,The Birth,23,Stopped for a Chunky.
5529,5529,Ross,833,1,23,The Birth,26,(weakly) No.
5531,5531,Ross,834,1,23,The Birth,28,"Dr. Franzblau, hi."
5535,5535,Ross,835,1,23,The Birth,32,"59 seconds. (holds up his watch) Quartz, ha."
5539,5539,Ross,836,1,23,The Birth,36,I'll get it.
5541,5541,Ross,837,1,23,The Birth,38,I got itI'm getting it!
5542,5542,Rachel,777,1,23,The Birth,39,"Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips."
5544,5544,Rachel,778,1,23,The Birth,41,"And if you need anything else, I(notices the handsome Dr. Franzblau)do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate."
5546,5546,Rachel,779,1,23,The Birth,43,"Oh, that's funny!"
5547,5547,Monica,799,1,23,The Birth,44,I want a baby.
5548,5548,Chandler,764,1,23,The Birth,45,"Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow."
5549,5549,Monica,800,1,23,The Birth,46,Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
5550,5550,Chandler,765,1,23,The Birth,47,"Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
5551,5551,Joey,549,1,23,The Birth,48,"(to the screen) Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too."
5553,5553,Joey,550,1,23,The Birth,50,"Oh, yeah."
5555,5555,Joey,551,1,23,The Birth,52,"Hey, listen, lady....(sees that she's pregnant)...whoa."
5557,5557,Joey,552,1,23,The Birth,54,Oh yeah? And who do you like?
5559,5559,Joey,553,1,23,The Birth,56,"The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?"
5561,5561,Joey,554,1,23,The Birth,58,"Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!"
5563,5563,Joey,555,1,23,The Birth,60,"Oh, oh, oh, sorry."
5565,5565,Joey,556,1,23,The Birth,62,"Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here."
5567,5567,Phoebe,598,1,23,The Birth,64,(singing)
5569,5569,Phoebe,599,1,23,The Birth,66,"Thanks, Ross."
5570,5570,Ross,838,1,23,The Birth,67,Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
5571,5571,Phoebe,600,1,23,The Birth,68,Ok.
5572,5572,Phoebe,601,1,23,The Birth,69,"Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute."
5573,5573,Monica,801,1,23,The Birth,70,No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
5574,5574,Chandler,766,1,23,The Birth,71,You'll get one.
5575,5575,Monica,802,1,23,The Birth,72,Oh yeah? When?
5576,5576,Chandler,767,1,23,The Birth,73,"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
5577,5577,Monica,803,1,23,The Birth,74,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
5578,5578,Chandler,768,1,23,The Birth,75,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
5579,5579,Monica,804,1,23,The Birth,76,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
5580,5580,Chandler,769,1,23,The Birth,77,"No, no, no."
5581,5581,Monica,805,1,23,The Birth,78,What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
5582,5582,Chandler,770,1,23,The Birth,79,"(trapped) Uh, uh."
5583,5583,Monica,806,1,23,The Birth,80,Well?
5584,5584,Chandler,771,1,23,The Birth,81,Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
5585,5585,Rachel,780,1,23,The Birth,82,Hey.
5586,5586,Phoebe,602,1,23,The Birth,83,"Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress."
5587,5587,Monica,807,1,23,The Birth,84,Did you go home and change?
5588,5588,Rachel,781,1,23,The Birth,85,"Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?"
5589,5589,Monica,808,1,23,The Birth,86,"No, I haven't seen him."
5590,5590,Rachel,782,1,23,The Birth,87,"Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if the baby needs him?"
5591,5591,Chandler,772,1,23,The Birth,88,"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?"
5592,5592,Rachel,783,1,23,The Birth,89,"Yeah, why?"
5593,5593,Chandler,773,1,23,The Birth,90,"No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)"
5595,5595,Joey,557,1,23,The Birth,92,Tribbiani.
5597,5597,Joey,558,1,23,The Birth,94,"(takes phone) Hi, yeah, it's me. (Listens) Oh, no no no, we're just friends. (Listens) Yeah, I'm single. (Listens) 25. (Listens) An actor. (Listens) Hello?"
5599,5599,Joey,559,1,23,The Birth,96,"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
5601,5601,Joey,560,1,23,The Birth,98,"Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
5603,5603,Joey,561,1,23,The Birth,100,"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?"
5604,5604,Joey,562,1,23,The Birth,101,You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
5606,5606,Joey,563,1,23,The Birth,103,"Oh, it is."
5608,5608,Joey,564,1,23,The Birth,105,It is.
5610,5610,Ross,839,1,23,The Birth,107,Breathe.
5612,5612,Ross,840,1,23,The Birth,109,Breathe.
5614,5614,Ross,841,1,23,The Birth,111,Breathe.
5617,5617,Ross,842,1,23,The Birth,114,"15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12..."
5620,5620,Ross,843,1,23,The Birth,117,Who the hell is Jordie?
5622,5622,Ross,844,1,23,The Birth,119,"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie."
5624,5624,Ross,845,1,23,The Birth,121,"What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco."
5626,5626,Ross,846,1,23,The Birth,123,I got it.
5628,5628,Ross,847,1,23,The Birth,125,"I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps."
5631,5631,Ross,848,1,23,The Birth,128,Why?
5633,5633,Ross,849,1,23,The Birth,130,"No, you started it."
5636,5636,Ross,850,1,23,The Birth,133,But...
5638,5638,Ross,851,1,23,The Birth,135,(to Susan) Thanks a lot.
5640,5640,Ross,852,1,23,The Birth,137,"(to Carol) Yeah, listen..."
5644,5644,Joey,565,1,23,The Birth,141,Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
5646,5646,Joey,566,1,23,The Birth,143,"(panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?"
5648,5648,Ross,853,1,23,The Birth,145,Please. This is so your fault.
5650,5650,Ross,854,1,23,The Birth,147,"Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
5652,5652,Ross,855,1,23,The Birth,149,You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
5654,5654,Ross,856,1,23,The Birth,151,"Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
5656,5656,Phoebe,603,1,23,The Birth,153,"Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!"
5657,5657,Ross,857,1,23,The Birth,154,"Yeah, Susan."
5658,5658,Phoebe,604,1,23,The Birth,155,"Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
5659,5659,Phoebe,605,1,23,The Birth,156,"Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?"
5662,5662,Ross,858,1,23,The Birth,159,"I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks backwards as if he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) Ow."
5664,5664,Rachel,784,1,23,The Birth,161,"No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
5666,5666,Rachel,785,1,23,The Birth,163,Ok?
5668,5668,Rachel,786,1,23,The Birth,165,"(to Dr. Franzblau) Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating."
5670,5670,Joey,567,1,23,The Birth,167,"Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!"
5672,5672,Ross,859,1,23,The Birth,169,Help! Help!
5673,5673,Phoebe,606,1,23,The Birth,170,"(singing) They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next...(sees Ross and Susan staring at her) la la la la la la."
5675,5675,Monica,809,1,23,The Birth,172,"Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, you don't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance? (Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet."
5676,5676,Chandler,774,1,23,The Birth,173,Where have you been?
5677,5677,Joey,568,1,23,The Birth,174,"Oh, just had a baby."
5678,5678,Chandler,775,1,23,The Birth,175,Mazel tov!
5680,5680,Rachel,787,1,23,The Birth,177,"(anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?"
5682,5682,Rachel,788,1,23,The Birth,179,"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
5684,5684,Rachel,789,1,23,The Birth,181,Oh.
5686,5686,Rachel,790,1,23,The Birth,183,I'm a waitress.
5688,5688,Rachel,791,1,23,The Birth,185,(getting the point) Yeah. Gotcha.
5690,5690,Rachel,792,1,23,The Birth,187,Ok. That's fine. (takes her earrings out)
5698,5698,Ross,860,1,23,The Birth,195,"Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
5700,5700,Ross,861,1,23,The Birth,197,"No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?"
5702,5702,Ross,862,1,23,The Birth,199,Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
5703,5703,Phoebe,607,1,23,The Birth,200,This is so great.
5704,5704,Ross,863,1,23,The Birth,201,You wanna explain that?
5705,5705,Phoebe,608,1,23,The Birth,202,"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'm sorry, you were fighting."
5707,5707,Monica,810,1,23,The Birth,204,I'm sure they'll be here soon.
5708,5708,Rachel,793,1,23,The Birth,205,"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
5709,5709,Joey,569,1,23,The Birth,206,Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
5710,5710,Chandler,776,1,23,The Birth,207,(to Joey) You are really frightening me.
5711,5711,Chandler,777,1,23,The Birth,208,"Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?"
5717,5717,Ross,864,1,23,The Birth,214,"Ok, got the vent open."
5718,5718,Phoebe,609,1,23,The Birth,215,"(reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!"
5719,5719,Ross,865,1,23,The Birth,216,"Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben."
5721,5721,Phoebe,610,1,23,The Birth,218,"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent."
5722,5722,Ross,866,1,23,The Birth,219,"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!"
5725,5725,Ross,867,1,23,The Birth,222,We're here!
5727,5727,Ross,868,1,23,The Birth,224,"Long story, honey."
5731,5731,Chandler,778,1,23,The Birth,228,"(to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?"
5734,5734,Ross,869,1,23,The Birth,231,"Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?"
5737,5737,Ross,870,1,23,The Birth,234,"(puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry."
5739,5739,Ross,871,1,23,The Birth,236,"We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person."
5742,5742,Ross,872,1,23,The Birth,239,"Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o."
5744,5744,Phoebe,611,1,23,The Birth,241,"(from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!"
5745,5745,Ross,873,1,23,The Birth,242,"Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
5747,5747,Ross,874,1,23,The Birth,244,(thinking) How 'bout Ben?
5750,5750,Ross,875,1,23,The Birth,247,"We uh, we just cooked it up."
5752,5752,Monica,811,1,23,The Birth,249,Hi.
5753,5753,Ross,876,1,23,The Birth,250,Hey.
5754,5754,Monica,812,1,23,The Birth,251,Can we come in?
5755,5755,Ross,877,1,23,The Birth,252,"(to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody."
5756,5756,Phoebe,612,1,23,The Birth,253,"Susan, he looks just like you."
5758,5758,Rachel,794,1,23,The Birth,255,"Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these."
5759,5759,Chandler,779,1,23,The Birth,256,"I know, I still am one of these."
5760,5760,Monica,813,1,23,The Birth,257,"Ross, can I?"
5761,5761,Ross,878,1,23,The Birth,258,"The head, the head. You gotta..."
5762,5762,Monica,814,1,23,The Birth,259,"(getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum."
5764,5764,Ross,879,1,23,The Birth,261,"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns)"
5765,5765,Chandler,780,1,23,The Birth,262,"And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. (Does a baseball sign.)"
5766,5766,Monica,815,1,23,The Birth,263,He is so amazing.
5767,5767,Rachel,795,1,23,The Birth,264,"Oh, I know. Look at him."
5768,5768,Joey,570,1,23,The Birth,265,"Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name."
5769,5769,Phoebe,613,1,23,The Birth,266,"Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he's opening his eyes. (picture comes back)"
5770,5770,Joey,571,1,23,The Birth,267,"He doesn't do much, does he?"
5771,5771,Ross,880,1,23,The Birth,268,"No, this is pretty much it."
5772,5772,Rachel,796,1,23,The Birth,269,You guys wanna get some coffee?
5774,5774,Ross,881,1,23,The Birth,271,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
5775,5775,Phoebe,614,1,23,The Birth,272,"Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again."
5776,5776,Ross,882,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,0,And here's little Ben nodding off...
5777,5777,Monica,816,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,1,"Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!"
5778,5778,Phoebe,615,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,2,"Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!"
5779,5779,Rachel,797,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,3,"Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!"
5780,5780,Ross,883,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,4,(quietly) That would be nice.
5781,5781,Rachel,798,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,5,Pardon?
5782,5782,Chandler,781,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,6,"Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)"
5783,5783,Joey,572,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,7,"Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back."
5784,5784,Chandler,782,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,8,"Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars."
5785,5785,Joey,573,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,9,"I will, really. I'll pay you back this time."
5786,5786,Chandler,783,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,10,(sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
5787,5787,Joey,574,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,11,Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
5788,5788,Ross,884,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,12,(overhearing) What kind of research?
5789,5789,Joey,575,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,13,"Oh, just, y'know.... science."
5790,5790,Ross,885,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,14,"Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued, they all look over)"
5791,5791,Joey,576,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,15,(sigh)... It's a fertility study.
5792,5792,Monica,817,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,16,"Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time."
5793,5793,Joey,577,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,17,"Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars."
5794,5794,Ross,886,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,18,Hey.
5795,5795,Phoebe,616,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,19,"Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!"
5796,5796,Monica,818,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,20,"OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns..."
5797,5797,Phoebe,617,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,21,"We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... (hands meat to Monica)"
5798,5798,Chandler,784,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,22,(in a deep voice) Men are here.
5799,5799,Joey,578,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,23,We make fire. Cook meat.
5800,5800,Chandler,785,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,24,"Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back."
5802,5802,Monica,819,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,26,"Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late."
5803,5803,Joey,579,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,27,"Oh, OK."
5804,5804,Phoebe,618,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,28,So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your (provocatively) special someone?
5805,5805,Joey,580,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,29,"I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great."
5806,5806,Monica,820,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,30,Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
5807,5807,Joey,581,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,31,"What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?"
5808,5808,Monica,821,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,32,Man's got a point.
5809,5809,Joey,582,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,33,"Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me."
5810,5810,Chandler,786,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,34,Crazy bitch.
5811,5811,Joey,583,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,35,"Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean."
5812,5812,Monica,822,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,36,Joey... we always know what you mean.
5813,5813,Phoebe,619,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,37,Hey.
5814,5814,Monica,823,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,38,Hey.
5815,5815,Ross,887,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,39,Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)
5816,5816,Phoebe,620,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,40,How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
5817,5817,Ross,888,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,41,I'm going to China.
5818,5818,Phoebe,621,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,42,"Jeez, you say one thing, and..."
5819,5819,Monica,824,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,43,You're going to China?
5820,5820,Ross,889,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,44,"Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to Monica)"
5821,5821,Phoebe,622,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,45,"Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)"
5822,5822,Ross,890,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,46,"(to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?"
5823,5823,Monica,825,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,47,Yeah.
5824,5824,Phoebe,623,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,48,"Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture down, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
5825,5825,Ross,891,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,49,"Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left."
5826,5826,Monica,826,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,50,"Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl."
5827,5827,Ross,892,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,51,"Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?"
5828,5828,Monica,827,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,52,"You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse."
5829,5829,Ross,893,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,53,No.
5830,5830,Phoebe,624,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,54,"Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the..."
5831,5831,Ross,894,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,55,"At the coffeehouse, right."
5832,5832,Phoebe,625,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,56,"So you do know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry."
5833,5833,Ross,895,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,57,"OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys."
5834,5834,Phoebe,626,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,58,"Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story."
5835,5835,Ross,896,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,59,Hi.
5836,5836,Joey,584,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,60,Hey!
5837,5837,Chandler,787,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,61,Hey!
5838,5838,Ross,897,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,62,(sigh)....I have to go to China.
5839,5839,Joey,585,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,63,The country?
5840,5840,Ross,898,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,64,"No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?"
5841,5841,Chandler,788,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,65,"Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
5842,5842,Ross,899,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,66,"Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
5843,5843,Joey,586,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,67,Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
5844,5844,Chandler,789,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,68,Forget about her.
5845,5845,Joey,587,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,69,"He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food."
5846,5846,Chandler,790,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,70,"Course there, they just call it food."
5847,5847,Ross,900,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,71,"Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)"
5848,5848,Joey,588,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,72,"Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
5849,5849,Ross,901,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,73,I know.
5850,5850,Joey,589,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,74,"We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)"
5851,5851,Chandler,791,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,75,I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
5853,5853,Joey,590,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,77,"Like the three musketeers, only with fruit."
5854,5854,Chandler,792,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,78,(sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
5855,5855,Monica,828,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,79,"(gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?"
5856,5856,Rachel,799,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,80,"Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)"
5857,5857,Monica,829,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,81,"Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?"
5858,5858,Joey,591,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,82,"Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I..."
5859,5859,Joey,592,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,83,"Then you do. Heh, heh."
5860,5860,Monica,830,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,84,"So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?"
5861,5861,Joey,593,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,85,What do you mean?
5862,5862,Monica,831,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,86,"Y'know, just be there for her."
5863,5863,Joey,594,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,87,Not following you.
5864,5864,Monica,832,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,88,Think about it.
5865,5865,Rachel,800,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,89,"OK, I'm guessing this is from..."
5866,5866,Rachel,801,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,90,"Well, thank you, Melanie."
5867,5867,Chandler,793,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,91,"(pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me."
5868,5868,Rachel,802,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,92,"(picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it's... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)"
5869,5869,Rachel,803,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,93,This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!
5870,5870,Phoebe,627,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,94,"Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!"
5871,5871,Joey,595,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,95,(to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.
5873,5873,Chandler,794,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,97,"Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die."
5874,5874,Rachel,804,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,98,Who's this from?
5875,5875,Chandler,795,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,99,"Oh, that's Ross's."
5876,5876,Rachel,805,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,100,Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
5877,5877,Phoebe,628,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,101,Remembered what?
5878,5878,Rachel,806,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,102,"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
5879,5879,Chandler,796,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,103,"Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)"
5880,5880,Phoebe,629,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,104,"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
5881,5881,Monica,833,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,105,I can't believe he did this.
5882,5882,Chandler,797,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,106,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
5883,5883,Rachel,807,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,107,What did you just say?
5884,5884,Chandler,798,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,108,(panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
5885,5885,Rachel,808,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,109,"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
5886,5886,Chandler,799,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,110,(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
5887,5887,Rachel,809,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,111,Oh.... my God.
5888,5888,Chandler,800,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,112,"(rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no...."
5889,5889,Joey,596,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,113,"(pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time."
5891,5891,Rachel,810,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,115,"I mean, this is unbelievable."
5892,5892,Phoebe,630,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,116,"I know. This is really, really huge."
5893,5893,Chandler,801,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,117,No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
5894,5894,Phoebe,631,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,118,Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
5895,5895,Chandler,802,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,119,"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
5896,5896,Monica,834,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,120,"I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?"
5897,5897,Rachel,811,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,121,"No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?"
5898,5898,Joey,597,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,122,"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something."
5899,5899,Rachel,812,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,123,"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)"
5900,5900,Chandler,803,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,124,(quickly) H-He's in China!
5901,5901,Joey,598,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,125,The country.
5902,5902,Monica,835,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,126,"No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes."
5903,5903,Chandler,804,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,127,What about the time difference?
5904,5904,Monica,836,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,128,From here to the airport?
5905,5905,Chandler,805,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,129,Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
5906,5906,Monica,837,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,130,"Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
5907,5907,Rachel,813,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,131,I-I-I don't know.
5908,5908,Chandler,806,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,132,Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
5909,5909,Joey,599,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,133,"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait."
5910,5910,Monica,838,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,134,"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
5911,5911,Rachel,814,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,135,I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
5912,5912,Phoebe,632,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,136,"Here, look, alright, does this help?"
5913,5913,Rachel,815,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,137,"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)"
5914,5914,Chandler,807,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,138,"Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)"
5915,5915,Ross,902,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,139,(something in Chinese)
5917,5917,Ross,903,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,141,Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)
5918,5918,Rachel,816,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,142,"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
5920,5920,Rachel,817,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,144,Hi.
5922,5922,Rachel,818,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,146,"Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
5924,5924,Rachel,819,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,148,"No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
5926,5926,Rachel,820,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,150,"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important."
5928,5928,Rachel,821,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,152,Uh... I don't know.
5934,5934,Joey,600,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,158,"Heh, heh. It was nothin'."
5936,5936,Joey,601,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,160,"(panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn."
5938,5938,Joey,602,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,162,Sure! Why not?
5941,5941,Joey,603,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,165,How do you mean?
5943,5943,Monica,839,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,167,"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?"
5944,5944,Rachel,822,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,168,"I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross."
5946,5946,Rachel,823,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,170,"I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
5947,5947,Monica,840,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,171,"Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!"
5948,5948,Phoebe,633,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,172,"Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date."
5949,5949,Monica,841,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,173,Another good point.
5950,5950,Phoebe,634,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,174,"No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed."
5951,5951,Rachel,824,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,175,(confused) Huh?
5952,5952,Phoebe,635,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,176,"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
5953,5953,Monica,842,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,177,Why isn't it working out?
5954,5954,Rachel,825,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,178,I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
5955,5955,Monica,843,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,179,Is he not cute enough for you?
5956,5956,Rachel,826,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,180,No!
5957,5957,Monica,844,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,181,Does he not make enough money?
5958,5958,Rachel,827,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,182,"No, I'm just...."
5959,5959,Phoebe,636,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,183,Maybe there's someone else.
5960,5960,Rachel,828,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,184,Wha...
5961,5961,Monica,845,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,185,Is there? Is there someone else?
5962,5962,Rachel,829,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,186,No! There is.. there is noone else!
5963,5963,Monica,846,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,187,Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
5964,5964,Chandler,808,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,188,"Hey, big..."
5965,5965,Joey,604,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,189,Shhhh!
5966,5966,Chandler,809,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,190,(quietly) ...spender.
5967,5967,Joey,605,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,191,She's still asleep.
5968,5968,Chandler,810,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,192,So how'd it go?
5969,5969,Joey,606,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,193,"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
5970,5970,Chandler,811,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,194,The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
5971,5971,Joey,607,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,195,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!"
5972,5972,Chandler,812,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,196,"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route."
5973,5973,Joey,608,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,197,"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level."
5974,5974,Chandler,813,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,198,I didn't know you had another level.
5975,5975,Joey,609,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,199,I know! Neither did I!
5976,5976,Monica,847,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,200,"Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?"
5977,5977,Rachel,830,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,201,Yeah.
5978,5978,Monica,848,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,202,"Oh, from who?"
5979,5979,Rachel,831,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,203,From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
5980,5980,Monica,849,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,204,"Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?"
5981,5981,Rachel,832,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,205,"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
5982,5982,Monica,850,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,206,"Oh, why?"
5983,5983,Rachel,833,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,207,"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna..."
5984,5984,Monica,851,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,208,"(gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
5985,5985,Rachel,834,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,209,"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
5986,5986,Monica,852,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,210,"I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise."
5987,5987,Rachel,835,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,211,Who is it?
5989,5989,Rachel,836,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,213,C'mon up.
5990,5990,Monica,853,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,214,Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
5991,5991,Joey,610,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,215,Seven hundred bucks!
5992,5992,Chandler,814,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,216,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
5993,5993,Joey,611,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,217,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something."
5994,5994,Chandler,815,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,218,"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
5995,5995,Joey,612,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,219,"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)"
5997,5997,Ross,904,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,221,I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
5998,5998,Rachel,837,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,222,"Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here."
5999,5999,Ross,905,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,223,"Fine, just stop thinking about me."
6000,6000,Ross,906,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,224,"Can't do it, can you?"
6001,6001,Rachel,838,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,225,So I'm thinking about you. So what?
6002,6002,Ross,907,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,226,"I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?"
6003,6003,Rachel,839,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,227,Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
6005,6005,Ross,908,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,229,"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance."
6006,6006,Rachel,840,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,230,"Ross, it's too hard."
6007,6007,Ross,909,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,231,"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade."
6008,6008,Rachel,841,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,232,"Ross, you're like my best friend."
6009,6009,Ross,910,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,233,I know.
6010,6010,Rachel,842,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,234,"If we broke up, and I lost you..."
6011,6011,Ross,911,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,235,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?"
6012,6012,Rachel,843,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,236,"Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?"
6013,6013,Ross,912,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,237,"(pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?"
6014,6014,Rachel,844,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,238,"I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before."
6015,6015,Ross,913,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,239,"Well, start looking."
6016,6016,Rachel,845,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,240,Wow.
6018,6018,Rachel,846,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,242,Right! You're right!
6020,6020,Rachel,847,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,244,You know what?
6022,6022,Rachel,848,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,246,"I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her drink) I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry."
6024,6024,Rachel,849,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,248,"(sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi."
6026,6026,Ross,914,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,250,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
6028,6028,Ross,915,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,252,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
6030,6030,Ross,916,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,254,Yeah.
6032,6032,Ross,917,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,256,"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
6034,6034,Ross,918,1,24,Rachel Finds Out,258,"Come on, they're gonna love you."
