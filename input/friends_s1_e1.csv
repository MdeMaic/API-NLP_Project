0,0,Monica,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,0,There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
1,1,Joey,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,1,"C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!"
2,2,Chandler,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,2,"All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
3,3,Phoebe,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,3,"Wait, does he eat chalk?"
4,4,Phoebe,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,4,"Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!"
5,5,Monica,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,5,"Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
6,6,Chandler,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,6,Sounds like a date to me.
7,7,Chandler,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,7,"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
9,9,Chandler,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,9,"Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there."
10,10,Joey,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,10,Instead of...?
11,11,Chandler,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,11,That's right.
12,12,Joey,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,12,Never had that dream.
13,13,Phoebe,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,13,No.
14,14,Chandler,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,14,"All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me."
15,15,Monica,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,15,And they weren't looking at you before?!
16,16,Chandler,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,16,"Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
17,17,Ross,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,17,(mortified) Hi.
18,18,Joey,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,18,"This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
19,19,Monica,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,19,"Are you okay, sweetie?"
20,20,Ross,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,20,"I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck..."
21,21,Chandler,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,21,Cookie?
22,22,Monica,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,22,(explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.
23,23,Joey,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,23,Ohh.
24,24,Monica,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,24,(to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
25,25,Ross,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,25,Thanks.
26,26,Phoebe,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,26,Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)
27,27,Ross,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,27,"No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?"
28,28,Phoebe,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,28,Fine!  Be murky!
29,29,Ross,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,29,"I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
30,30,Monica,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,30,No you don't.
31,31,Ross,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,31,"No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
32,32,Joey,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,32,And you never knew she was a lesbian...
33,33,Ross,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,33,"No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
34,34,Chandler,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,34,Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
35,35,Ross,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,35,"I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well."
36,36,Monica,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,36,"Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., ""I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren."" was what?  A wrong number?"
37,37,Ross,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,37,Sorry.
38,38,Joey,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,38,"Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
39,39,Joey,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,39,"Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!"
40,40,Ross,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,40,"I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!"
41,41,Chandler,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,41,And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
42,42,Monica,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,42,Rachel?!
43,43,Rachel,0,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,43,"Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
45,45,Monica,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,45,"(pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?"
46,46,Rachel,1,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,46,"Hi, sure!"
47,47,Ross,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,47,Hi.
48,48,Monica,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,48,"So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?"
49,49,Rachel,2,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,49,"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city."
50,50,Monica,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,50,Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
51,51,Rachel,3,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,51,"Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... [Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]"
52,52,Monica,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,52,"Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it."
53,53,Chandler,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,53,(imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
54,54,Ross,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,54,(in a deep voice) I'll have whatever Christine is having.
55,55,Rachel,4,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,55,"(on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!"
56,56,Phoebe,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,56,"If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off."
57,57,Chandler,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,57,"(re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants."
58,58,Joey,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,58,I say push her down the stairs.
60,60,Rachel,5,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,60,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
61,61,Ross,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,61,You can see where he'd have trouble.
62,62,Rachel,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,62,"Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica."
63,63,Monica,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,63,"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica..."
64,64,Rachel,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,64,"Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
65,65,Monica,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,65,"Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things..."
66,66,Phoebe,6,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,66,"(sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few..."
67,67,Rachel,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,67,I'm all better now.
68,68,Phoebe,7,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,68,(grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!
69,69,Monica,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,69,"Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing."
70,70,Joey,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,70,"(comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
71,71,Monica,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,71,"Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!"
72,72,Joey,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,72,"What, like there's a rule or something?"
73,73,Chandler,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,73,"Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound."
75,75,Monica,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,75,"Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!"
76,76,Joey,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,76,Who's Paul?
77,77,Ross,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,77,"Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
78,78,Monica,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,78,Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
79,79,Ross,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,79,He finally asked you out?
80,80,Monica,19,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,80,Yes!
81,81,Chandler,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,81,"Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
82,82,Monica,20,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,82,"Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
83,83,Rachel,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,83,"Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
84,84,Monica,21,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,84,"(to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?"
85,85,Ross,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,85,(choked voice) That'd be good...
86,86,Monica,22,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,86,(horrified) Really?
87,87,Ross,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,87,"(normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!"
88,88,Phoebe,8,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,88,"What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
89,89,Monica,23,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,89,"Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
91,91,Chandler,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,91,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?"
92,92,Monica,24,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,92,"Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
93,93,Ross,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,93,A wandering?
94,94,Monica,25,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,94,"Change!  Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds."
95,95,Phoebe,9,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,95,"Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good."
96,96,Joey,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,96,"Hey, Paul!"
98,98,Joey,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,98,"Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red."
99,99,Monica,26,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,99,"(yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!"
100,100,Ross,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,100,"So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?"
101,101,Rachel,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,101,"Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
102,102,Ross,19,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,102,"Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
103,103,Chandler,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,103,"(deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it."
104,104,Rachel,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,104,"Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day."
105,105,Ross,20,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,105,"Okay, sure."
106,106,Joey,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,106,"Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
107,107,Phoebe,10,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,107,"Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
109,109,Phoebe,11,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,109,"(singing) Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
110,110,Ross,21,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,110,"(squatting and reading the instructions) I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
111,111,Joey,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,111,I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
112,112,Chandler,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,112,It's a beautiful thing.
113,113,Joey,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,113,(picking up a leftover part) What's this?
114,114,Chandler,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,114,I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
115,115,Joey,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,115,Which goes where?
116,116,Chandler,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,116,I have no idea.
117,117,Joey,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,117,Done with the bookcase!
118,118,Chandler,19,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,118,All finished!
119,119,Ross,22,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,119,"(clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
120,120,Joey,19,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,120,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
121,121,Chandler,20,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,121,"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun."
122,122,Joey,20,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,122,"Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
123,123,Ross,23,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,123,You guys.
124,124,Chandler,21,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,124,"Oh, God."
125,125,Joey,21,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,125,You got screwed.
126,126,Chandler,22,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,126,Oh my God!
127,127,Monica,27,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,127,Oh my God!
129,129,Monica,28,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,129,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
131,131,Monica,29,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,131,-leg?
133,133,Monica,30,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,133,"You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
135,135,Monica,31,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,135,"That's right. [Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]"
136,136,Rachel,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,136,"Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
137,137,Ross,24,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,137,I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
138,138,Joey,22,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,138,Shut up!
139,139,Chandler,23,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,139,You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
140,140,Ross,25,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,140,That only took me an hour.
141,141,Chandler,24,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,141,"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!"
142,142,Ross,26,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,142,"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
143,143,Joey,23,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,143,"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
144,144,Ross,27,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,144,I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
145,145,Chandler,25,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,145,"Stay out of my freezer! [Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]"
147,147,Monica,32,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,147,"What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?"
149,149,Monica,33,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,149,"Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
151,151,Monica,34,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,151,"Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?"
153,153,Monica,35,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,153,"(spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
155,155,Monica,36,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,155,I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
157,157,Monica,37,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,157,Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
159,159,Monica,38,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,159,"(pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
161,161,Rachel,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,161,Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
162,162,Ross,28,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,162,"(scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?"
163,163,Joey,24,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,163,"Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)"
164,164,Chandler,26,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,164,"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats."
165,165,Joey,25,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,165,Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)
166,166,Ross,29,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,166,"Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)"
168,168,Rachel,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,168,"Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life."
169,169,Chandler,27,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,169,That is amazing.
170,170,Joey,26,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,170,Congratulations.
171,171,Rachel,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,171,"Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
172,172,Chandler,28,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,172,"If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do."
173,173,Joey,27,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,173,"Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that hungry..."
174,174,Monica,39,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,174,"(entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
177,177,Joey,28,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,177,"Morning, Paul."
178,178,Rachel,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,178,"Hello, Paul."
179,179,Chandler,29,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,179,"Hi, Paul, is it?"
181,181,Monica,40,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,181,Stop!
183,183,Monica,41,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,183,We'll talk later.
185,185,Joey,29,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,185,That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
186,186,Monica,42,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,186,"Shut up, and put my table back."
188,188,Chandler,30,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,188,"All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference..."
189,189,Rachel,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,189,"So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
190,190,Monica,43,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,190,"Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff."
191,191,Joey,30,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,191,"Yeah, I'm an actor."
192,192,Rachel,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,192,Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
193,193,Joey,31,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,193,I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
194,194,Monica,44,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,194,"Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park."
195,195,Joey,32,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,195,"Look, it was a job all right?"
196,196,Chandler,31,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,196,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
197,197,Joey,33,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,197,I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)
198,198,Chandler,32,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,198,"You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
199,199,Joey,34,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,199,"You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.)"
200,200,Monica,45,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,200,So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
201,201,Rachel,19,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,201,I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
202,202,Monica,46,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,202,"I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?"
203,203,Rachel,20,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,203,"Oh, yeah."
204,204,Monica,47,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,204,"Well, it's like that. With feelings."
205,205,Rachel,21,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,205,Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
206,206,Monica,48,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,206,Big time!
207,207,Rachel,22,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,207,Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.
208,208,Monica,49,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,208,"I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
209,209,Rachel,23,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,209,"Oh, look, wish me luck!"
210,210,Monica,50,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,210,What for?
211,211,Rachel,24,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,211,I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job things.
213,213,Monica,51,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,213,"Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?"
215,215,Monica,52,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,215,How do you do that?
217,217,Monica,53,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,217,You know Paul?
219,219,Monica,54,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,219,You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
221,221,Joey,35,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,221,(sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!
222,222,Monica,55,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,222,"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?"
223,223,Ross,30,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,223,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
224,224,Monica,56,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,224,I hate men!  I hate men!
225,225,Phoebe,12,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,225,"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe."
226,226,Monica,57,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,226,Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
227,227,Phoebe,13,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,227,"All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)"
228,228,Monica,58,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,228,"I just thought he was nice, y'know?"
229,229,Joey,36,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,229,(bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
230,230,Rachel,25,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,230,Guess what?
231,231,Ross,31,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,231,You got a job?
232,232,Rachel,26,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,232,Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
233,233,Chandler,33,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,233,And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
234,234,Rachel,27,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,234,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!"
235,235,Chandler,34,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,235,"Oh, how well you know me..."
236,236,Rachel,28,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,236,"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!"
237,237,Monica,59,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,237,How'd you pay for them?
238,238,Rachel,29,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,238,"Uh, credit card."
239,239,Monica,60,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,239,And who pays for that?
240,240,Rachel,30,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,240,Um... my... father.
241,241,Rachel,31,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,241,"Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want."
242,242,Monica,61,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,242,"C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life."
243,243,Rachel,32,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,243,I know that. That's why I was getting married.
244,244,Phoebe,14,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,244,"Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time."
245,245,Rachel,33,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,245,Thank you.
246,246,Phoebe,15,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,246,"You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel."
247,247,Ross,32,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,247,The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
248,248,Monica,62,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,248,"All right, you ready?"
249,249,Rachel,34,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,249,"No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!"
250,250,Monica,63,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,250,"You can, I know you can!"
251,251,Rachel,35,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,251,I don't think so.
252,252,Ross,33,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,252,"Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)"
253,253,Ross,34,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,253,"C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,..."
255,255,Rachel,36,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,255,Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
256,256,Monica,64,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,256,Rachel!  That was a library card!
258,258,Chandler,35,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,258,"(as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream."
259,259,Monica,65,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,259,Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
260,260,Monica,66,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,260,"Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?"
261,261,Ross,35,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,261,"No. No, I gotta go home sometime."
262,262,Monica,67,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,262,You be okay?
263,263,Ross,36,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,263,Yeah.
264,264,Rachel,37,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,264,"Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?"
265,265,Monica,68,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,265,"That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody."
267,267,Ross,37,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,267,"Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no-"
268,268,Rachel,38,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,268,Sorry-
269,269,Ross,38,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,269,"No no no, go-"
270,270,Rachel,39,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,270,"No, you have it, really, I don't want it-"
271,271,Ross,39,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,271,Split it?
272,272,Rachel,40,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,272,Okay.
273,273,Ross,40,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,273,"Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
274,274,Rachel,41,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,274,I knew.
275,275,Ross,41,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,275,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
276,276,Rachel,42,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,276,I did.
277,277,Ross,42,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,277,"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?"
278,278,Rachel,43,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,278,"Yeah, maybe..."
279,279,Ross,43,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,279,"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
280,280,Rachel,44,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,280,Goodnight.
281,281,Ross,44,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,281,Goodnight.
282,282,Monica,69,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,282,"See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?"
283,283,Ross,45,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,283,I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.)
285,285,Joey,37,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,285,I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
286,286,Phoebe,16,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,286,(sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
287,287,Monica,70,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,287,What? I-I said you had a-
288,288,Phoebe,17,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,288,(sings) What I said you had...
289,289,Monica,71,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,289,(to Phoebe) Would you stop?
290,290,Phoebe,18,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,290,"Oh, was I doing it again?"
292,292,Monica,72,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,292,"I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt."
293,293,Joey,38,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,293,"Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya."
294,294,Ross,46,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,294,There's an image.
295,295,Rachel,45,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,295,(walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee?
296,296,Chandler,36,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,296,"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?"
297,297,Rachel,46,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,297,I'm just serving it.
299,299,Chandler,37,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,299,"Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)"
301,301,Rachel,47,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,301,"Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the gang.) Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas."
302,302,Chandler,38,1,1,Monica Gets A Roommate,302,"Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-"
